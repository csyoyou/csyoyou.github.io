The grid will have a pre-designated “goal”&lt;br&gt;position to be found. The bot will move about on the grid using a fixed set of simple commands&lt;br&gt;that are provided to the Bot at its construction. There will be a time limit as to how long the&lt;br&gt;simulation of the bot on the grid is allowed. The simulation ends when either the Bot finds the&lt;br&gt;goal or when the limit of simulation steps is reached.&lt;br&gt;Grid&lt;br&gt;The grid is a square with individual coordinates that we designate as (x,y) that contains a goal&lt;br&gt;position. We assume that the bottom left corner of the grid is (0,0) and that y is the vertical&lt;br&gt;direction and x the horizontal direction. Both x and y are greater than or equal to 0. Both the&lt;br&gt;dimensions of the grid and the goal position are provided as input, and we guarantee that the&lt;br&gt;provided goal position is within the grid. There is no wrap-around on this grid. Like a Roomba&lt;br&gt;bot, if a bot moves forward/backward into a wall, its position remains unchanged (it bumps into&lt;br&gt;the wall and cannot finish the move) and it moves on to executing its next command.&lt;br&gt;Bot&lt;br&gt;The bot is very simple, similar to a turtle graphics turtle. A bot has:&lt;br&gt;• a position in x,y coordinates (the grid)&lt;br&gt;o the initial position is provided as input, guaranteed to fit on the grid&lt;br&gt;• a direction the bot faces, represented by four characters: nàNorth, sàSouth, eàEast,&lt;br&gt;wàWest.&lt;br&gt;o the initial direction is provided as input.&lt;br&gt;• four commands it can respond to, also represented as characters:&lt;br&gt;o l à turn left, r à turn right. The turns do not change the position of the bot, only&lt;br&gt;its facing direction. A turn results in a change of facing direction to one of the&lt;br&gt;four cardinal directions: n, s, e, w. Thus if the bot is facing west and turns left, it&lt;br&gt;will now be facing south without a change of position.&lt;br&gt;o f à forward, b à backward, move bot one space, forward or backward, in the&lt;br&gt;direction it is facing. If the bot cannot move because of an obstruction of a wall,&lt;br&gt;then its position does not change.&lt;br&gt;o A single string is provided that is a sequence of some combination of these&lt;br&gt;commands. For example “fblr” is a command sequence. The command string is a&lt;br&gt;sequence that is repeated. That is, once ‘f’, ‘b’, ‘l’, ‘r’ are each executed, execution&lt;br&gt;begins again at the start of the sequence, executing ‘f’.&lt;br&gt;o&lt;br&gt;Assignment Overview&lt;br&gt;The main program will read in:&lt;br&gt;• 3 parameters for a Grid: its dimensions and the x and y positions of the goal&lt;br&gt;• 4 parameters for the Bot: its initial position as x and y, its initial direction and its&lt;br&gt;command string.&lt;br&gt;• a limit for the number of Bot steps to be taken&lt;br&gt;The main loop will execute as long as the goal has not yet been reached and as long as the&lt;br&gt;number of Bot steps is less than the limit.&lt;br&gt;At each Bot step:&lt;br&gt;• the Bot will execute its next command.&lt;br&gt;• the count of Bot steps executed will be updated.&lt;br&gt;At the end (by limit or by reaching the goal, either one), the main will print the final position of&lt;br&gt;the Bot and whether it had reached its goal.&lt;br&gt;Class public elements&lt;br&gt;You can design the private elements of your class anyway you like. That is, whatever underlying&lt;br&gt;data structures you would like in your class, do it.&lt;br&gt;I’ll give you the public method declarations (not the definitions L) I used to make the class.&lt;br&gt;They will be on hackerrank as well. These are “good ideas”, but it is up to you. The ones that&lt;br&gt;absolutely have to be there , because they are in the main program, are:&lt;br&gt;• all the constructors (all of them, how many are there???)&lt;br&gt;• Bot’s execute_command&lt;br&gt;• Bot’s overloaded operator&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;br&gt;• Bot’s at_goal&lt;br&gt;class Grid{&lt;br&gt;private:&lt;br&gt;// data members you need go here&lt;br&gt;public:&lt;br&gt;Grid()=default;&lt;br&gt;Grid(size_t, size_t, size_t);&lt;br&gt;friend class Bot;&lt;br&gt;};&lt;br&gt;// Grid function members here&lt;br&gt;class Bot{&lt;br&gt;private:&lt;br&gt;// data members you need go here&lt;br&gt;public:&lt;br&gt;Bot()=default;&lt;br&gt;Bot(size_t, size_t, char, string, Grid&amp;amp;);&lt;br&gt;void forward();&lt;br&gt;void back();&lt;br&gt;void left();&lt;br&gt;void right();&lt;br&gt;void execute_command();&lt;br&gt;bool at_goal();&lt;br&gt;friend ostream&amp;amp; operator&amp;lt;&amp;lt;(ostream&amp;amp;,Bot&amp;amp;);&lt;br&gt;};&lt;br&gt;// Bot function members here&lt;br&gt;Things to note&lt;br&gt;• A Grid instance is a parameter to the Bot constructor. Why is that? The Grid knows its&lt;br&gt;dimensions and it knows the position of the goal. The Bot can inquire of those values, which&lt;br&gt;it needs, through its Grid instance.&lt;br&gt;• Grid needs to come before Bot, since Bot needs a Grid in its construction.&lt;br&gt;• The Grid is a friend class of the Bot. That means that the Bot has access to the private data&lt;br&gt;members of the Grid. That will make the code a little easier to write.&lt;br&gt;• There is a friend function for printing a Bot. It has a very particular format to pass&lt;br&gt;hackerrank, which is&lt;br&gt;o (x,y) facing:d Where x,y are its position and d is the direction, a single&lt;br&gt;character. Get it right!&lt;br&gt;• There is a commented line in the main loop to print the Bot at the beginning of each cycle.&lt;br&gt;You should use that (and other output as well) to track how you are doing.&lt;br&gt;• Do whatever you like to main, but in the end you should turn in the single file with the main&lt;br&gt;exactly as we showed you in the beginning.&lt;br&gt;Deliverables&lt;br&gt;You must use Handin to turn in the file proj08.cpp – this is your source code solution; be sure to&lt;br&gt;include your section, the date, the project number and comments describing your code. You can&lt;br&gt;check your results using hackerrank as before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turtle乌龟画图的初级入门作业，总共5个exercise，包括运行python运行，用命令行操作，画图形等等入门功能&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CSI 100 Turtle Graphics Lab&lt;br&gt;1 Introduction&lt;br&gt;Welcome to CSI100! This lab is a head-first introduction to programming. Here are the important things&lt;br&gt;to know:&lt;br&gt;• Don’t Panic! The most important thing that this lab is about is managing confusion. There will be&lt;br&gt;a lot of confusion in learning how to program. Try things and ask lots of questions!&lt;br&gt;• In this lab we are going to draw pictures with turtles. It’s a classic exercise for introducing new&lt;br&gt;programmers to code, and it can make really cool pictures!&lt;br&gt;• Work in pairs. We’ll do this a lot in this class. The two of you should share a laptop, and share your&lt;br&gt;ideas too. You will be able to upload deliverables to canvas as a group.&lt;br&gt;• There is just one deliverable for this lab, in section 4. Basically, you will draw a cool picture and&lt;br&gt;upload it to canvas.&lt;br&gt;2 Running your first Python program&lt;br&gt;In this section of the lab, we’ll download and run our first python program. Let’s start by getting the code.&lt;br&gt;Go to canvas and find the files for today’s lab. Save a copy of turtle lab.py to your Downloads folder.&lt;br&gt;Comment 1 Why save your file to the Downloads folder? For this lab, it is just somewhere easy to&lt;br&gt;find. In the future, feel free to use any location you prefer on your computer. Remember that the lab&lt;br&gt;laptops reset on every reboot, so they probably won’t be there anymore by next class.&lt;br&gt;Comment 2 The lab computers have both OS X and Windows installed. For our labs, we will work in&lt;br&gt;OS X. If your computer boots into Windows, switch operating systems by restarting the computer. Hold&lt;br&gt;down the ‘Option’ key when you see the grey loading screen. Let go when you see startup icons appear,&lt;br&gt;and choose ‘Macintosh HD’&lt;br&gt;The code that you downloaded, turtle lab.py, is just a text file. You can open it in any text editor,&lt;br&gt;like textEdit (mac) or Notepad (windows). Even better, the lab computers come with Sublime and Atom,&lt;br&gt;which are both programmer-oriented text editors. Most importantly, this means that they automatically&lt;br&gt;highlight code to make it easier to read.&lt;br&gt;Exercise 1 Go ahead and open turtle lab.py in a text editor. Some of the lines of code are special:&lt;br&gt;they are comments. Comments don’t contain any instructions for the computer; they just help other&lt;br&gt;programmers understand what is going on.&lt;br&gt;Figure out which lines are comments. How do you think you would add a new comment to the&lt;br&gt;program?&lt;br&gt;Now we want to run the program. This means telling python to read through turtle lab.py and execute&lt;br&gt;each instruction in order. To do this, we need to use the command line. You can open the command line by&lt;br&gt;clicking on the spotlight icon ( ) on the right side of the mac menu bar. Search for and open Terminal,&lt;br&gt;which is the mac command line.&lt;br&gt;Comment 3 We usually interact with computers through a mix of keyboard, mouse, and touchscreens.&lt;br&gt;When we want to give instructions precisely and formally, like in programming, the keyboard is often&lt;br&gt;most helpful. The command line is a text-based interface to the computer. We type commands, press&lt;br&gt;enter, and then the computer executes them.&lt;br&gt;1 of 4&lt;br&gt;CSI 100 Turtle Graphics Lab&lt;br&gt;The command line is like the Finder: it is always in a folder, and you can move it from one folder to&lt;br&gt;another. In order to run turtle lab.py, we need to navigate to the Downloads folder where we put the file.&lt;br&gt;The rest of this section will introduce a few command line commands to let you do this.&lt;br&gt;The command line always starts up in your home folder. If you type pwd (which stands for “print working&lt;br&gt;directory”), the command line will tell you what its courent directory is.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; pwd&lt;br&gt;/Users/wilsonkl&lt;br&gt;Comment 4 Your command line probably actually looks more like this:&lt;br&gt;WC-07792:~ student$ pwd&lt;br&gt;/Users/student&lt;br&gt;This is normal. The WC-07792:~ student$ part is called the command line prompt. Since it changes&lt;br&gt;so much from one computer to another, when programmers communicate to each other, they usually&lt;br&gt;just write &amp;gt; as a sort of standard prompt, even though no one’s prompt looks exactly like that.&lt;br&gt;You can also see a list of all of the files and folder that are in the current directory using ls (for “list”):&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; ls&lt;br&gt;Applications Library anaconda&lt;br&gt;Desktop Movies Documents&lt;br&gt;Music Downloads Pictures&lt;br&gt;Dropbox Public Google Drive&lt;br&gt;Comment 5 Your output may look slightly different depending on what files and folders are in your&lt;br&gt;home directory. This is what mine shows.&lt;br&gt;Some of these folders should look familiar, like Desktop and Documents. We want to move to the&lt;br&gt;Downloads folder. To do that, we’ll use the cd command (for “change directory”).&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; pwd&lt;br&gt;/Users/wilsonkl&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; cd Downloads&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; pwd&lt;br&gt;/Users/wilsonkl/Downloads&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; ls&lt;br&gt;turtle_lab.py&lt;br&gt;Now that we are here in the Downloads folder where our code is, we can tell python to run it by typing&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; python turtle_lab.py&lt;br&gt;Exercise 2 Follow the directions above to download a copy of turtle lab.py, open a command line,&lt;br&gt;navigate to the Downloads folder, and run the code.&lt;br&gt;Do you see an image pop up that looks like the following?&lt;br&gt;2 of 4&lt;br&gt;CSI 100 Turtle Graphics Lab&lt;br&gt;Comment 6 There are many other handy commands for moving around on the command line. In&lt;br&gt;particular, cd .. (two dots) moves up one directory, and cd (with nothing after it) takes you back to&lt;br&gt;your home directory.&lt;br&gt;3 Working with turtles&lt;br&gt;Imagine a small invisible turtle with a pen in its mouth. In turtle graphics, we draw pictures by giving&lt;br&gt;a turtle directions: “go forwards”, “turn left”, “turn right”. The instructions in turtle lab.py have the&lt;br&gt;turtle first go forwards 100 units, then turn left by 45 degrees, and then go forwards another 200 units.&lt;br&gt;t.forward(100)&lt;br&gt;t.left(45)&lt;br&gt;t.forward(200)&lt;br&gt;The three basic turtle commands are forward, left, and right. Using just combinations of these, you can&lt;br&gt;make the turtle draw some very complicated things.&lt;br&gt;Exercise 3 Which direction is the turtle initially facing, before it starts moving?&lt;br&gt;Exercise 4 Change the code in turtle lab.py to make the turtle draw a square. How would you do&lt;br&gt;an equilateral triangle, or a hexagon?&lt;br&gt;4 Your turn&lt;br&gt;Now it’s your turn to experiment! For some inspiration, here is a cool picture made with turtle graphics:&lt;br&gt;Figure 1: A turtle drawing made by repeatedly moving and turning.&lt;br&gt;Also, here are some other commands that you can give to your turtles:&lt;br&gt;3 of 4&lt;br&gt;CSI 100 Turtle Graphics Lab&lt;br&gt;penup() Tell the turtle to lift up it’s pen. It will still move as usual, but will not leave a mark.&lt;br&gt;pendown() Tell the turtle to put it’s pen down on the paper, so that it leaves a mark. The pen starts down&lt;br&gt;unless you lift it.&lt;br&gt;pencolor(’red’) Change the color of line that the turtle draws. Other colors work too, such as ’black’,&lt;br&gt;’blue’, ’magenta’, and many others.&lt;br&gt;pensize(10) Change the thickness of the line that the turtle draws. The default is 10, so pensize(12)&lt;br&gt;draws a slightly thicker line.&lt;br&gt;Repeating. There is a way to repeat the same commands many times without lots of copying and pasting.&lt;br&gt;Here is an example:&lt;br&gt;for i in range(10):&lt;br&gt;t.forward(20)&lt;br&gt;t.left(20)&lt;br&gt;This will cause turtle t to go forward 20 steps, and the turn left 20 degrees, and to repeat those actions a&lt;br&gt;total of 10 times. Repeating code like this is called looping.&lt;br&gt;Comment 7 This looping code has one line that is not indented, and then two lines that are. Inden-&lt;br&gt;tation is important in python, and we will talk about what it means in detail later in the course. For&lt;br&gt;now, know that indentation should be exactly four spaces, and that only indented lines get repeated by&lt;br&gt;this loop.&lt;br&gt;Exercise 5 (Turn in) Now it’s your turn! Draw a cool picture with your turtle. Take a screenshot&lt;br&gt;and upload it (as a group) to canvas.&lt;br&gt;4 of 4&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

The goal of the sliding puzzle game is that to move&lt;br&gt;tiles to end up with a desired state. We are only allowed to move tiles in certain ways.&lt;br&gt;First, before we start anything, let’s play the game we will build:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mypuzzle.org/sliding&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;http://mypuzzle.org/sliding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;We use the same graphics library in this game we used in Project 2.&lt;br&gt;The game will be dynamic in terms of size. We will be able to run our game with board sizes of 3x3,&lt;br&gt;4x4, 5x5 etc.&lt;br&gt;Let’s watch the video of the final version of our game:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/m0w2kXKg0LU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/m0w2kXKg0LU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The details of the project is given in the project skeleton and in the recitation slides.&lt;br&gt;Turning in Your Work&lt;br&gt;●  Submit your completed file (project4_skel.py) on Vocareum.&lt;br&gt;Rubric&lt;br&gt;Project 4&lt;br&gt;Task01: PuzzleWindow.update()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task02: PuzzleWindow .get_click_position()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task03: PuzzleWindow .get_random_color()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task04: PuzzleWindow.paint_with_random_colors()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task05: PuzzleWindow.animation()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task06: Board. shuffle_one()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task07: Board.play_click()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task08: Board. play_key()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task09: Board.done()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task10: Cell. get_neighbor_cells()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task11: TopScores.add_score()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task12: TopScores.write_scores()  10%&lt;br&gt;Task13: TopScores. print_scores()  10%&lt;br&gt;TOTAL  130%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

Worth 30% of final mark.&lt;br&gt;Design and code a Used Car System in Java.&lt;br&gt;This will be a menu based Used Car System, using standard input/output.&lt;br&gt;Joe’s Garage buys and sells vehicles. They may buy a used car from a customer that has some&lt;br&gt;damage, and improve its condition before they sell it. Joe’s garage is a small family business and&lt;br&gt;can only store 20 cars at any time.&lt;br&gt;The details of operation are flexible and left to your imagination. The main functions are:&lt;br&gt; Add a new car to the system when it is purchased, noting the purchase price and date of&lt;br&gt;purchase. A new car can only be purchased if there are currently less than 20 cars for sale.&lt;br&gt; Sell a car to a customer, noting the sale price and date of sale. The car is marked as sold.&lt;br&gt;Its details are kept in the system for use in sales reports.&lt;br&gt; Display a list of all cars for sale sorted by date of purchase.&lt;br&gt; Display a sales report showing all car sales. Show the purchase price, sale price. Show the&lt;br&gt;total profit at the end of the report.&lt;br&gt;In addition, the program;&lt;br&gt; Reads a list of cars from a text file at start up. The cars are stored in a suitable data&lt;br&gt;structure in memory.&lt;br&gt; Saves all cars to a text file just before the program exits.&lt;br&gt;Note, the storage in the text file must be true object persistence. Objects will be read from the file&lt;br&gt;at the program commencement and stored prior to program termination. All operations on objects&lt;br&gt;(cars) must be done in memory.&lt;br&gt;CSE105-CW3: Java programming project 2&lt;br&gt;It is expected that you will have:&lt;br&gt; At least one Java class to control the operation of the system.&lt;br&gt; At least one Java class to store data as objects.&lt;br&gt;Use a package name of CSE105 for java classes.&lt;br&gt;The expected level of comments in the Java code:&lt;br&gt;Typically, one line of comment to describe each method. Comments are not needed for getters&lt;br&gt;and setters of data classes. Include your name and student number as a comment at the top of&lt;br&gt;each class.&lt;br&gt;You will submit:&lt;br&gt;1. A report in the form of one Word document containing:&lt;br&gt;a. System Design. The detailed design of each class showing attributes and methods.&lt;br&gt;b. Testing. Show the test cases needed to test the system. Show the actual test&lt;br&gt;results obtained by running the system.&lt;br&gt;2. Implementation (coding):&lt;br&gt;a. 1 file for each class (ie.  . java files)&lt;br&gt;b. 1 text file containing the data.&lt;br&gt;You must pack all of your files with WinRAR or WinZIP, using your student ID as the file name and&lt;br&gt;then upload one rar/zip file to ICE. Each student should also submit a hardcopy of the&lt;br&gt;assignment. The content must be identical to the electronic version.&lt;br&gt;Note, the project must contain English characters only – no Chinese.&lt;br&gt;This assignment is individual work. Plagiarism (e.g. copying materials from other sources&lt;br&gt;without proper acknowledgement) is a serious academic offence. Plagiarism will not be tolerated&lt;br&gt;and will be dealt with in accordance with the University Code of Practice on Assessment.&lt;br&gt;CSE105-CW3: Java programming project 3&lt;br&gt;Marking scheme for CW3 project.&lt;br&gt;Assessment criteria  Percentage&lt;br&gt;A design document is provided. Class names, main attributes, and&lt;br&gt;behaviour are shown. The overall design of the classes and methods&lt;br&gt;within are properly presented. OO principles are observed including&lt;br&gt;encapsulation and appropriate use of static and object methods.&lt;br&gt;Sufficient detail is shown to enable implementation. Do not use Java&lt;br&gt;code in the design. Pseudocode or equivalent should be used.&lt;br&gt;20&lt;br&gt;Test cases. Test cases are provided to test all functions of the&lt;br&gt;system.&lt;br&gt;10&lt;br&gt;Test results are properly presented showing expected and actual&lt;br&gt;results for all test cases.&lt;br&gt;10&lt;br&gt;Main functions work. 4 functions x 10 marks.  40&lt;br&gt;Data storage in text file.

There should be no file extension after the file name&lt;br&gt;“README”. Your README should include the following sections:&lt;br&gt;Program Descriptions ( 5 points ) : Provide a high level description of what each of your programs do and&lt;br&gt;how you can interact with them. Make this explanation such that your grandpa or uncle or someone you know&lt;br&gt;who has no programming experience can understand what these programs do and how to use them. Do not&lt;br&gt;assume your reader is a computer science major.&lt;br&gt;Short Response ( 5 points ) : Answer the following questions:&lt;br&gt;Vim Questions:&lt;br&gt;1. In vim/gvim, what commands will indent N consecutive lines (starting from the cursor line) by one level&lt;br&gt;where the indent level is defined to be two spaces? This will take two vim commands: one to set the&lt;br&gt;number of spaces to indent with each indent level (default is 8), and one to actually indent N&lt;br&gt;consecutive lines. Likewise what command will shift N lines left (de-indent N lines)?&lt;br&gt;2. In vim/gvim, what command will indent an entire curly-bracket block one level, while the cursor is&lt;br&gt;currently on either the open or close curly bracket of the block? Likewise what command will shift an&lt;br&gt;entire curly-bracket block one level left (de-indent block)?&lt;br&gt;3. How do you open a new line below and insert (one keyboard key for both steps)?&lt;br&gt;Unix Question:&lt;br&gt;4. On the Unix command line, how can you capture (redirect) the program’s output into a file named&lt;br&gt;“output”?&lt;br&gt;Java Question:&lt;br&gt;5. How can you create an array of ints in Java and initialize it with the values of all single digit odd positive&lt;br&gt;numbers (inclusively between 0-9), all in one step/line?&lt;br&gt;STYLE ( 20 points )&lt;br&gt;Please see preview programming assignments; especially PA2’s writeup.  You will be specifically graded on&lt;br&gt;commenting, file headers, class and method headers, meaningful variable names, judicious use of blank lines,&lt;br&gt;not having more than 80 characters on a line, perfect indentation, no magic numbers/hard-coded numbers&lt;br&gt;other than -1, 0, +1, using setters and getters, etc (see the style section of PA2’s writeup).&lt;br&gt;You will lose significant points if you have static methods or static variables for the Spin100 program&lt;br&gt;(except, constants are okay). Instead you should create getters and setters to change the variables for an&lt;br&gt;object.&lt;br&gt;CORRECTNESS ( 70 points )&lt;br&gt;Start by creating your pa7 directory as usual. Then copy over the starter code from the public folder by doing&lt;br&gt;the following:&lt;br&gt;$ cp ~/../public/PA7indrome.java ~/pa7&lt;br&gt;$ cp ~/../public/PA7-images/&lt;em&gt; ~/pa7&lt;br&gt;Program 1: PA7indrome ( 20 Points )&lt;br&gt;You must use recursion and implement the methods listed below or you will lose all 20 points for this&lt;br&gt;program. Also,  do not edit the main() method in PA7indrome.java as it will negatively affect your grade.&lt;br&gt;Write a command line application that checks whether an array of strings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a&lt;br&gt;word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same forwards and backwards. The&lt;br&gt;program will take in a file as a command line argument. Each line of the file will be converted into a string,&lt;br&gt;where each string will be placed as an element in an arraylist then converted to an array (this part has already&lt;br&gt;been written for you in the main() method–do not edit anything in this method). Your task will be to then&lt;br&gt;determine if the array of strings is a palindrome or not (non-case sensitive). You will be using two recursive&lt;br&gt;methods to implement this functionality.&lt;br&gt;public static char[] reverse( char[] toRev ) {…}&lt;br&gt;● Overall goal: reverse the array of characters passed in using recursion.&lt;br&gt;● If the length of the character array passed in is 1, just return the array right away.&lt;br&gt;● Otherwise, swap the first and last characters in the array (#1-3 below)&lt;br&gt;● Copy the middle of the array into a new array and recursively call reverse on this new array (#4 below).&lt;br&gt;● Place the returned array back into the middle of the original array of characters, and return this&lt;br&gt;reversed array of characters (#5 below).&lt;br&gt;● Hint: you can use System.arraycopy() (look up the javadocs).&lt;br&gt;● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.&lt;br&gt;public static boolean isPalindrome( String[] words, int lo, int hi ) {…}&lt;br&gt;● Overall goal: determine if the array of strings passed in is a palindrome using recursion.&lt;br&gt;● Determine if the string at the low index in the words array is the reverse of the string at the high index in&lt;br&gt;the words array. To do so, you must use your reverse() function, after converting the string to a char&lt;br&gt;array and passing it in. This comparison should be non-case sensitive.&lt;br&gt;● If the string at the low index is indeed the reverse of the string at the high index, recurse on the&lt;br&gt;remaining middle portion of the array by passing modified values of the low and high index in the&lt;br&gt;recursive call. Otherwise, return false.&lt;br&gt;● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.&lt;br&gt;You must use these methods as they are defined above or you will lose points.&lt;br&gt;We will test for edge cases when grading this assignment, so it is up to you to test your program thoroughly.&lt;br&gt;Similar to previous assignments, your output MUST match exactly to our sample output!&lt;br&gt;Sample Output 1: Not a palindrome (user input in BOLD)&lt;br&gt;For this example, the input file is named notPalindrome. If you open the file in vim, it should look like this:&lt;br&gt;start&lt;br&gt;early&lt;br&gt;start&lt;br&gt;often&lt;br&gt;The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:&lt;br&gt;[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome notPalindrome&lt;br&gt;Input array of strings:&lt;br&gt;start, early, start, often&lt;br&gt;The file is not a palindrome.&lt;br&gt;[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$&lt;br&gt;Sample Output 2: Odd-length palindrome (user input in BOLD)&lt;br&gt;Input file named oddPalindrome:&lt;br&gt;StArT&lt;br&gt;EaRlY&lt;br&gt;sTaRt&lt;br&gt;oFtEn&lt;br&gt;ufotofu&lt;br&gt;NeTfO&lt;br&gt;TrAtS&lt;br&gt;yLrAe&lt;br&gt;tRaTs&lt;br&gt;The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:&lt;br&gt;[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome oddPalindrome&lt;br&gt;Input array of strings:&lt;br&gt;StArT, EaRlY, sTaRt, oFtEn, ufotofu, NeTfO, TrAtS, yLrAe, tRaTs&lt;br&gt;The file is a palindrome.&lt;br&gt;[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$&lt;br&gt;The sequence of characters in the array of Strings generated from the input file reads the same forwards and&lt;br&gt;backwards (non-case sensitive), so it is a palindrome. Note that because the length of the array is odd, the&lt;br&gt;middle string must also be a palindrome (in this case the middle string is “ufotofu”, which is a palindrome).&lt;br&gt;Sample Output 3: Even-length palindrome (user input in BOLD)&lt;br&gt;Input file named evenPalindrome:&lt;br&gt;StArT&lt;br&gt;EaRlY&lt;br&gt;sTaRt&lt;br&gt;oFtEn&lt;br&gt;NeTfO&lt;br&gt;TrAtS&lt;br&gt;yLrAe&lt;br&gt;tRaTs&lt;br&gt;The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:&lt;br&gt;[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome evenPalindrome&lt;br&gt;Input array of strings:&lt;br&gt;StArT, EaRlY, sTaRt, oFtEn, NeTfO, TrAtS, yLrAe, tRaTs&lt;br&gt;The file is a palindrome.&lt;br&gt;[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$&lt;br&gt;Sample Output 4: Palindrome with new lines (user input in BOLD)&lt;br&gt;Input file named newLinesPalindrome. Note: New lines will be cut off (ignored) by the scanner.&lt;br&gt;StArT&lt;br&gt;EaRlY&lt;br&gt;sTaRt&lt;br&gt;oFtEn&lt;br&gt;NeTfO&lt;br&gt;TrAtS&lt;br&gt;yLrAe&lt;br&gt;tRaTs&lt;br&gt;The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:&lt;br&gt;[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome newLinesPalindrome&lt;br&gt;Input array of strings:&lt;br&gt;StArT, EaRlY, sTaRt, oFtEn, NeTfO, TrAtS, yLrAe, tRaTs&lt;br&gt;The file is a palindrome.&lt;br&gt;[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$&lt;br&gt;Program 2: Spin100 ( 50 Points )&lt;br&gt;You are to design a game that models itself after the mini game found in the Price is Right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFJCfNib2ns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFJCfNib2ns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Main idea of the game:&lt;br&gt;● There are two players: Player 1 and Player 2. Player 1 gets to spin the wheel first. Player 1 gets to&lt;br&gt;spin until they have reached over 100 points or have clicked the “Finish Player 1” button. At that point,&lt;br&gt;it becomes Player 2’s turn. Player 2 then gets to spin until they have reached over 100 points or have&lt;br&gt;clicked the “Finish Player 2” button.&lt;br&gt;● Once Player 2 goes over 100 points or clicks the “Finish Player 2” button, the game ends.&lt;br&gt;● Whichever player is closer to 100 points wins. Once a player goes over 100 points then they’ve lost. If&lt;br&gt;both players go over 100 points then it’s a tie. If both players have the same score, then it’s a tie.&lt;br&gt;Example scores and their outcomes:&lt;br&gt;Player 1  70  120  20  100  100  95&lt;br&gt;Player 2  90  110  120  100  105  100&lt;br&gt;Winner  Player 2  Tie  Player 1  Tie  Player 1  Player 2&lt;br&gt;Implementation Details:&lt;br&gt;This program will have two Java source files: Spin100Controller.java and Spin100Wheel.java.&lt;br&gt;Spin100Controller.java will be the main controller which extends WindowController and handles the GUI&lt;br&gt;layout. Spin100Wheel.java will be the actual wheel object that defines what a wheel can do, how it spins, etc.&lt;br&gt;1. Setting up the GUI:&lt;br&gt;Start by first getting the GUI set up in the begin() method of Spin100Controller.java.&lt;br&gt;The top panel will have 3 labels:&lt;br&gt;● “Spin100” - You can customize the font of this label–don’t worry about whether the font is the default or&lt;br&gt;not! Just make sure your program doesn’t throw errors or have an incorrect layout / text upon start.&lt;br&gt;● “Player 1’s score: “ - followed by player 1’s score (initially 0).&lt;br&gt;● “Player 2’s score: “ - followed by player 2’s score (initially 0).&lt;br&gt;○ Note the space following the ‘:’ for each player’s score&lt;br&gt;The bottom panel will have 5 buttons: (make sure the text matches exactly).&lt;br&gt;● “Click to Spin P1”&lt;br&gt;● “Finish Player 1”&lt;br&gt;● “Restart”&lt;br&gt;● “Click to Spin P2”&lt;br&gt;● “Finish Player 2”&lt;br&gt;The wheels on the center canvas:&lt;br&gt;● The center of the window will have the canvas, similar to PA6. The height and width of the canvas&lt;br&gt;should be 840 x 660. Note that the canvas will not be resized during testing. On the canvas we will&lt;br&gt;be displaying two wheels (one for each player). In order to create the wheels, we need to initialize an&lt;br&gt;array of Image(s), using the images you copied over from the public folder. Make sure your images&lt;br&gt;are directly inside your pa7 directory, and not in a subdirectory called PA7-images.&lt;br&gt;● You will want to load the 20 images into an array of Images. To ensure you arrange the images in the&lt;br&gt;correct order, we suggest creating the following array. This will ensure you load the images in the&lt;br&gt;correct order and will also be helpful for scoring later on. Load the images corresponding to these&lt;br&gt;score values in the order in which they appear in the array. The array of images and the array of score&lt;br&gt;values will be parallel arrays.&lt;br&gt;private static final int[] SCORES = { 50, 85, 30, 65, 10, 45, 70, 25, 90, 5,&lt;br&gt;100, 15, 80, 35, 60, 20, 40, 75, 55, 95 };&lt;br&gt;● The wheel should always start with 50 in the center and should spin in a downward direction. This&lt;br&gt;means that when the wheel spins for the first time, the red arrow will first point to 50, then 85, then 30,&lt;br&gt;and so on.&lt;br&gt;● You will want to create each wheel by calling the Spin100Wheel constructor. Some parameters you will&lt;br&gt;probably want to pass to the constructor are:&lt;br&gt;○ The array of Image(s) corresponding to the SCORES values.&lt;br&gt;○ Location of the wheel (location of the top number). The center of the left wheel should be&lt;br&gt;horizontally aligned with the center of the left half of the canvas. In other words, you need to find&lt;br&gt;the x-coordinate that will center the left wheel in the center of the left half of the canvas.&lt;br&gt;Similarly, you need to find the x-coordinate that will center the right wheel in the center of the&lt;br&gt;right half of the canvas. The y-coordinate of the top number for both wheels should be 10 (make&lt;br&gt;sure the layout of your wheels matches the screenshots exactly).&lt;br&gt;○ Reference to the Spin100Controller so that controller methods can be called from the wheel&lt;br&gt;(this will be useful for setting the score after the wheel stops spinning each time)&lt;br&gt;○ Reference to the drawing canvas so the wheel can be placed on the canvas&lt;br&gt;The red arrows on the center canvas:&lt;br&gt;● The arrows are red-filled arcs with start angle = -15, arc angle = 30, height = 150, and width = 150.&lt;br&gt;● Left arrow position: (234.5, 186.0)&lt;br&gt;● Right arrow position: (688.5, 186.0)&lt;br&gt;Messages declaring winner on the center canvas:&lt;br&gt;● Create a hidden text object saying “Tie” at position (444, 5). The text should be blue, bold, and size 16.&lt;br&gt;● Create a hidden text object saying “P1 Winner” at position (20, 5). The text should be green, bold, and&lt;br&gt;size 16.&lt;br&gt;● Create a hidden text object saying “P2 Winner” at position (808, 5). The text should be green, bold,&lt;br&gt;and size 16.&lt;br&gt;See the screenshot section below to see what all of this looks like.&lt;br&gt;2. Wheel Functionality&lt;br&gt;Because the wheels are animated, the Spin100Wheel class needs to extend ActiveObject (and therefore must&lt;br&gt;contain a run() method).&lt;br&gt;Creating a wheel:&lt;br&gt;● Each wheel needs an array of 5 VisibleImages (generated from the array of images passed in as a&lt;br&gt;parameter to the constructor) to store the 5 images that will be visible on the canvas at any given time.&lt;br&gt;● The location passed to the constructor is the location of the topmost VisibleImage. The next&lt;br&gt;VisibleImage will be 99 pixels below that, and the next 99 pixels below that, and so on.&lt;br&gt;● Each wheel needs a random double generator object to generate random numbers for the amount of&lt;br&gt;ticks to spin when the spin button is clicked (see more details below in the Spinning the wheel section).&lt;br&gt;● Don’t forget to save a reference to the Spin100Controller object to help with scoring.&lt;br&gt;● Set the number of ticks to 0, so the wheel begins stationary.&lt;br&gt;● As with all ActiveObjects, the last statement in the constructor should be start();.&lt;br&gt;Spinning the wheel:&lt;br&gt;● Initially, the wheel’s number of ticks should be set to zero. When a wheel’s spin button is clicked, the&lt;br&gt;controller should update the number of ticks so the wheel will start spinning. This means you will want&lt;br&gt;a method to generate a random number of ticks for the wheel to spin.&lt;br&gt;● One way to implement this is to have a method called getRandomTicks(). This method should:&lt;br&gt;○ First generate a random double between 0 and 1&lt;br&gt;○ Based on the random number, return the minimum number of ticks (50) + a number of&lt;br&gt;additional ticks, which indicates how many ticks a wheel should spin for. This is to allow the&lt;br&gt;wheel to stop on different numbers each time by randomizing where a wheel stops cycling&lt;br&gt;through the array of images.&lt;br&gt;○ If the random number is between 0 and 0.05, return MIN_TICKS + 1. If it’s between .05 and .1,&lt;br&gt;return MIN_TICKS + 2. You should keep adding one more tick until you return MIN_TICKS + 13&lt;br&gt;for when the value is between .6 and .65. From there you should subtract one less tick until you&lt;br&gt;return MIN_TICKS + 6 when the value is between .95 and 1.&lt;br&gt;■ Range of ticks to add (over the .05 increments) is&lt;br&gt;(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6)&lt;br&gt;● After getting the random number of ticks, the controller needs to set the wheel’s number of ticks using a&lt;br&gt;setter method.&lt;br&gt;● To make the wheel actually spin, the run method will need to constantly check its number of ticks. If&lt;br&gt;the number of ticks is greater than 0, increment the index of each visible image displayed to the next&lt;br&gt;index in the images array; in other words, for every tick, shift the images down one. Once you reach&lt;br&gt;the last index of the images array, wrap back around to the beginning (Hint: think mod operator).&lt;br&gt;Then decrement the number of ticks left for this wheel to spin and pause to slow down the animation.&lt;br&gt;● At the beginning of each spin, the initial delay should be set to 1. Then when the wheel delay is less&lt;br&gt;than 20, the wheel delay should increment by 1 on every iteration of the forever loop. When the wheel&lt;br&gt;delay is greater than or equal to 20 and less than 200, the wheel delay should increment by 5. When&lt;br&gt;the wheel delay is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 500, the wheel delay should increment by&lt;br&gt;20. This will give the illusion of a faster spin at the start which eventually slows down and stops once&lt;br&gt;the number of ticks is zero.&lt;br&gt;● Once the number of ticks is 0, the wheel needs to call a public method in controller to let the controller&lt;br&gt;know that the wheel’s score has changed and that the Text object for the score needs to be updated.&lt;br&gt;● Some additional methods to include in the class would be setters and getters for the ticks, delay, and&lt;br&gt;score. This is so that the controller can call these methods and change the wheel’s variables’ values&lt;br&gt;when something like the spin, finish, or reset button is pressed.&lt;br&gt;3. Controller Functionality&lt;br&gt;You will implement Spin100Controller.java to handle creating the buttons and listening to actions performed on&lt;br&gt;the buttons.&lt;br&gt;● Upon start, only the “Click to Spin P1” and “Restart” buttons should be enabled. So in your begin()&lt;br&gt;method, in addition to setting up the layouts of the buttons, you should also disable the “Finish Player 1”&lt;br&gt;button and all buttons associated with Player 2.&lt;br&gt;● Once you have clicked “Click to Spin P1”, all buttons are disabled until the wheel stops spinning. Once&lt;br&gt;the wheel stops spinning, update Player 1’s score. Now that you have spun Player 1’s wheel at least&lt;br&gt;once, the “Finish Player 1” button should be enabled.&lt;br&gt;● As long as Player 1’s score is less than or equal to 100, Player 1 can choose to continue spinning by&lt;br&gt;clicking “Click to Spin P1” again, or click “Finish Player 1” to finish their turn. Once Player 1’s score is&lt;br&gt;over 100, the controller will automatically finish the turn for Player 1.&lt;br&gt;● Once Player 1 has finished, all of Player 1’s buttons are disabled and the “Click to Spin P2” button is&lt;br&gt;enabled for Player 2 to start spinning. The spinning process follows the same condition as stated for&lt;br&gt;Player 1.&lt;br&gt;● Once Player 2 has also finished, all but the Restart button should be disabled. A game over message&lt;br&gt;should be displayed. The message could announce a Tie, or announce that either Player 1 or Player 2&lt;br&gt;won (see screenshots for detail).&lt;br&gt;Summary of the buttons&lt;br&gt;● The Spin buttons: The spin button disables itself when:&lt;br&gt;○ The wheels are spinning&lt;br&gt;○ The player’s score has passed 100&lt;br&gt;○ The player has clicked finish after at least one spin&lt;br&gt;● The Finish buttons: Each player’s finish button is disabled until they have spun at least once. It is also&lt;br&gt;disabled when the wheel is spinning, as well as after they have finished their turn.&lt;br&gt;● The Restart button: This button is always enabled except when a wheel is spinning. Once clicked:&lt;br&gt;○ It changes the scores back to 0&lt;br&gt;○ It resets the wheels so that 50 is at the center again&lt;br&gt;○ The “Click To Spin P1” button is enabled again and the buttons are reset to the original state.&lt;br&gt;Implementation Requirements for Button Event Handling&lt;br&gt;To manage the behaviors of the 5 buttons, you must define 5 private member inner classes inside the&lt;br&gt;Spin100Controller class. Use your notes from class as a reference.&lt;br&gt;● Each private class must implement the ActionListener interface.&lt;br&gt;● The ActionListener interface enforces that each class has the actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method&lt;br&gt;declared and implemented.&lt;br&gt;Having separate inner classes for each button is much better than handling all button events in one&lt;br&gt;actionPerformed() method. This is because there is a one-to-one relationship between buttons and listeners,&lt;br&gt;resulting in cleaner code that is less prone to errors.&lt;br&gt;Note: Remember to use getters/setters vs. directly accessing variables by name.&lt;br&gt;4. Sample Screenshots:&lt;br&gt;The start of the program. Both&lt;br&gt;player’s scores are set to 0,&lt;br&gt;with the arrows pointing to 50.&lt;br&gt;Only the buttons: “Click to Spin&lt;br&gt;P1” and “Restart” are enabled.&lt;br&gt;After Player 1 clicks “Click to&lt;br&gt;Spin P1”, the score for Player&lt;br&gt;1 is updated. The “Finish&lt;br&gt;Player 1” button is now&lt;br&gt;enabled after 1 spin.&lt;br&gt;Player 1 clicks “Finish Player&lt;br&gt;1”, and now only “Restart” and&lt;br&gt;“Click to Spin P2” buttons are&lt;br&gt;enabled.&lt;br&gt;Player 2 now clicks “Click to&lt;br&gt;Spin P2”, the score for Player&lt;br&gt;2 is updated. “Finish Player 2”&lt;br&gt;button is now enabled after the&lt;br&gt;first spin.&lt;br&gt;After Player 2 clicks “Finish&lt;br&gt;Player 2” The winner text&lt;br&gt;appears. The only button&lt;br&gt;enabled is “Restart”.&lt;br&gt;This is the case when Player&lt;br&gt;1’s score is over 100, thus&lt;br&gt;Player 2 wins.&lt;br&gt;In the case that Player 1’s&lt;br&gt;score exceeds 100, the&lt;br&gt;buttons “Click to Spin P1” and&lt;br&gt;“Finish Player 1” are&lt;br&gt;automatically disabled,&lt;br&gt;allowing P2 to begin.&lt;br&gt;If both player’s scores exceed&lt;br&gt;100, the game results in a tie.&lt;br&gt;Turnin&lt;br&gt;To turnin your code, navigate to your home directory and run the following command:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; cse11turnin pa7&lt;br&gt;You may turn in your programming assignment as many times as you like. The last submission you turn in&lt;br&gt;before the deadline is the one that we will collect.&lt;br&gt;Verify&lt;br&gt;To verify a previously turned in assignment,&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; cse11verify pa7&lt;br&gt;If you are unsure your program has been turned in, use the verify command. We will not take any late files you&lt;br&gt;forgot to turn in. Verify will help you check which files you have successfully submitted.&lt;br&gt;It is your responsibility to make sure you properly turned in your assignment.&lt;br&gt;Files to be collected:&lt;br&gt;Note: You must turn in all the files necessary for your program to run, including the .jar files and .png files.&lt;br&gt;Note: Also, if any exceptions are thrown in the terminal, you will lose points.&lt;br&gt;Source Files:  Image Files:  Misc:&lt;br&gt;PA7indrome.java&lt;br&gt;Spin100Controller.java&lt;br&gt;Spin100Wheel.java
&lt;/em&gt;.png (20 of them)  objectdraw.jar&lt;br&gt;Acme.jar&lt;br&gt;README&lt;br&gt;EC_Spin100Controller.java (extra credit)&lt;br&gt;EC_Spin100Wheel.java (extra credit)&lt;br&gt;Extra Credit ( 5 points )&lt;br&gt;Setup: Create copies of your regular source files and name them EC_Spin100Controller.java and&lt;br&gt;EC_Spin100Wheel.java.&lt;br&gt;Along with the functionality listed below, you will need to change the size of the window if you are adding the&lt;br&gt;extra buttons. Set the canvas width to 1000 and the canvas height to 660.&lt;br&gt;Overall Wins: 1 Point&lt;br&gt;Keep track of the overall wins with a message that appears at the end of the game:&lt;br&gt;Overall Wins P1: #, P2 @&lt;br&gt;where # is a non-negative number indicating how many times player 1 has won the game and @ is a non-&lt;br&gt;negative number indicating how many times player 2 has won the game. This message cannot overlap either&lt;br&gt;wheel and it should be horizontally centered between the wheels. It should be 200 pixels above the vertical&lt;br&gt;center of the canvas. The message can be in whatever color you would like besides black. In the case of a tie,&lt;br&gt;neither player’s win count should change.&lt;br&gt;Change Spin Direction: 1 Point&lt;br&gt;Add some new buttons and change the old ones so that each player has the option to spin up or down. There&lt;br&gt;should be a “P1, Spin Up” button, “P1, Spin Down” button, “P2, Spin Up” button, and “P2, Spin Down” button.&lt;br&gt;To clarify, spinning up is where the numbers appear to be moving up (so the 50 goes towards the top) whereas&lt;br&gt;spinning down is where the numbers appear to be moving down (so the 50 moves towards the bottom). You&lt;br&gt;can see the new buttons in the screenshots below. Disabling the buttons should still work the same as it does&lt;br&gt;in the normal portion of the PA, just make sure to disable both the Up and Down spin buttons.&lt;br&gt;Switch Starting Players: 3 Points&lt;br&gt;The “Switch” button is enabled only at the start of each round of the game. This button should be disabled in&lt;br&gt;the middle of a game (i.e. if a spin has occurred). This allows the player who spins first to switch with the other&lt;br&gt;player. For instance, if Player 1 was going to start first and the switch button is clicked. then the game will&lt;br&gt;restart and Player 2 will now start first. If the restart button were then clicked, Player 2 would still be going first.&lt;br&gt;Sample Screenshots:&lt;br&gt;If all extra credit features are implemented, this is the initial state of the program.&lt;br&gt;The overall number of wins for each player is shown when a round finishes.&lt;br&gt;Player 2 can begin the round of a game when “Switch” is clicked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;中级难度&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;完成意大利儿童纸牌游戏的完整版。居于上一次作业的重构和改进，主要游戏的游戏规则，&lt;br&gt;根据规则写相关的操作逻辑，并且完成测试。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CS1210 Computer Science I: Foundations&lt;br&gt;Homework 5: Ruba Mazzetto, Completed&lt;br&gt;Due Monday, October 31 at 11:59PM&lt;br&gt;Introduction&lt;br&gt;In Homework 4, you completed the simple implementation of the Italian children’s card game called&lt;br&gt;Ruba Mazzetto. In this homework, we’ll finally finish the complete version of the game that pits you&lt;br&gt;against any number of other players, and includes provisions for taking more than one card each turn. In&lt;br&gt;the interest of brevity, you can refer to the descriptions of Homework 3 and Homework 4 for more&lt;br&gt;information about the game.&lt;br&gt;Background&lt;br&gt;For this assignment, we’ll start with a refactored version of the Homework 4 solution, that incorporates&lt;br&gt;one small change to the rules of the game 1 and significantly revamps the structure of the play() function.&lt;br&gt;Your job is to complete this refactored version to support taking more than one card per turn, where the&lt;br&gt;cards matched must sum to the value of the card played. So, for example, the solution to Homework 5 will&lt;br&gt;behave as follows (excerpt taken from the middle of a 3-player game):&lt;br&gt;Pl aye r 0 :&lt;br&gt;St ash : [P l aye r 1] 7♠ (&lt;em&gt;3) , [P l aye r 2] 6♥ (&lt;/em&gt;2)&lt;br&gt;Ta b l e : [3] 10♦, [4] 3♦&lt;br&gt;My hand : [0] 10♣, [1] 10♠&lt;br&gt;Pl ay wh i ch ca rd? 0&lt;br&gt;Se l ec t ma t ch i ng i nd ece s sepa r a t ed by spa c es (b l ank t o d i sca rd) : 1 4&lt;br&gt;Pl aye r 0 p l ays 10♣ and . . .&lt;br&gt;. . . . t ake s 3♦ f rom t ab l e&lt;br&gt;. . . . s t ea l s p l aye r 1 s t ash 7♠&lt;br&gt;=========&lt;br&gt;Pl aye r 1 :&lt;br&gt;St ash : [P l aye r 0] 10♣ (&lt;em&gt;5) , [P l aye r 2] 6♥ (&lt;/em&gt;2)&lt;br&gt;Ta b l e : [3] 10♦&lt;br&gt;Pl aye r 1 p l ays 6♦ and . . .&lt;br&gt;. . . . s t ea l s p l aye r 2 s t ash 6♥&lt;br&gt;=========&lt;br&gt;Pl aye r 2 :&lt;br&gt;St ash : [P l aye r 0] 10♣ (&lt;em&gt;5) , [P l aye r 1] 6♦ (&lt;/em&gt;3)&lt;br&gt;Ta b l e : [3] 10♦&lt;br&gt;Pl aye r 2 add s 1♦ t o t ab l e&lt;br&gt;1&lt;br&gt;The small change referred to here has to do with what happens to the cards that remain on the table at the end&lt;br&gt;of the game. In the ‘‘real’’ version of the game, the last person to match cards from the table or another player’s&lt;br&gt;stash is gifted all of the remaining cards on the table when everyone else has finished playing their cards. This&lt;br&gt;change has been incorporated into the play() function.&lt;br&gt;1 Revised October 24, 2016&lt;br&gt;Note how Player 0 uses the 10♣ to match a 3♦ from the table and the 7♣ from Player 1’s stash (because&lt;br&gt;10 = 3 + 7).&lt;br&gt;As for HW4, to make this homework feasible, you will be provided a code skeleton containing nearly all&lt;br&gt;of the code you will need for the solution. Your assignment is to complete the functions getMove() and&lt;br&gt;pickMove(), but you should begin by studying the code skeleton file carefully.&lt;br&gt;def play(N=2, K=10)&lt;br&gt;The play() function has undergone the most significant reworking since the previous assignment. Aside&lt;br&gt;from an additional variable, which changes the parameters of the deck you play with, the big change is in&lt;br&gt;the main iteration that continues until the deck is exhausted. Previously, this loop was divided into two&lt;br&gt;sections: one for the human player and one for everyone else. The new structure merges these two&lt;br&gt;sections into a single loop and relegates the differentiation of the human player from the computer&lt;br&gt;player(s) to getMove(). The last change to play() involves assignment of any cards remaining on the table&lt;br&gt;to the last player who successfully matched, a job handled by the addition of a variable, last, that is reset&lt;br&gt;each time a player makes a match.&lt;br&gt;def getMove(i, N, H, T, P)&lt;br&gt;The purpose of getMove() has changed significantly from HW4. In HW4, getMove() was to return a&lt;br&gt;single ‘‘best’’ move for a given (automated) player, where each move consisted only of matching a single&lt;br&gt;card from the player’s hand with a single card from the table or the top card from an opposing player’s&lt;br&gt;stash. But now that we permit matching a single card from the player’s hand with the sum of multiple&lt;br&gt;cards from the table or from the top of each opposing player’s stash, we need to generate and then&lt;br&gt;consider the space of all possible legal moves. Each move is represented as (c, M), where c is the index&lt;br&gt;into the player’s hand correspond to the card they will play and M is a list of indeces selected from the&lt;br&gt;table and/or the opposing player’s stashes such that sum(M)≡ H[i][c][0]. If (c, M) is (c,[]), then the&lt;br&gt;move corresponds to discarding c to the table.&lt;br&gt;Your job is to implement helper(c,v, j, M, L) to generate all legal moves, from which one will be&lt;br&gt;selected and returned as the value of getMove(). Let’s examine getMove() more closely:&lt;br&gt;(1)  The first step is to determine if the argument i relates to the human player (i ≡0). If so, then move&lt;br&gt;selection is relegated to pickMove().&lt;br&gt;(2)  The second step invokes the as-yet-unwritten helper function helper(c,v, j, M, L) repeatedly&lt;br&gt;(once for each card held by the current player) to generate the list L of all legal moves.&lt;br&gt;(3)  The third step returns a random card to discard if no legal moves were found.&lt;br&gt;(4)  The final step returns the legal move that maximizes the number of cards captured by the current&lt;br&gt;player (note that other heuristics might be used to make a ‘‘best’’ move selection from the list L of&lt;br&gt;legal moves).&lt;br&gt;The helper() function is a recursive function that constructs the set of legal moves. If you think of the&lt;br&gt;len(T) cards on the table and the up to N − 1 player stashes (excluding the current player’s stash) as&lt;br&gt;defining a space of size 2 len(T)+N−1 , you will need to enumerate the up to this many card combinations by&lt;br&gt;considering possible inclusion or exclusion of each successive card. The arguments to&lt;br&gt;helper(c,v, j, M, L) are designed to help you do so.&lt;br&gt;(1)  The first argument, c, is the index of the card you are trying to match from player i’s hand.&lt;br&gt;(2)  The second argument, v, initially the value of c, represents how many ‘‘points’’ remain to match&lt;br&gt;with the addition of each successive card. When this number reaches 0, you know the cards&lt;br&gt;you’ve selected so far sum to the original value you were trying to match.&lt;br&gt;2 Revised October 24, 2016&lt;br&gt;(3)  The third argument, j, initially 0, is the index of the card you are currently considering adding to&lt;br&gt;the legal move you are construction. On each successive recursive call, you’ll increase j by 1 to&lt;br&gt;indicate you are going to consider the next card, from 0 through N up to N + len(T) − 1. At each&lt;br&gt;recursive step, you will want to explore both adding the jth card to the current legal move or not&lt;br&gt;adding it.&lt;br&gt;(4)  The fourth argument, M, initially [], is the legal move under construction. Each time you elect to&lt;br&gt;include an additional card, you will need to extend M to include that card’s index.&lt;br&gt;(5)  The last argument, L, initially [], is the list of legal moves you have found so far. Each new leg al&lt;br&gt;move you discover should be added to L, and the updated L should be the value returned from&lt;br&gt;helper().&lt;br&gt;def pickMove(i, N, H, T, P)&lt;br&gt;pickMove() is called by getMove() when the first argument i to getMove() corresponds to the human&lt;br&gt;player. pickMove() interacts with the user to obtain a legal move (c, M). Note that pickMove() must&lt;br&gt;guarantee that the move is both legal in every sense and that the cards selected from the table and the top&lt;br&gt;of any opposing player’s stash do, in fact, sum to the value of the card selected from the player’s hand.&lt;br&gt;The Ground Rules&lt;br&gt;Because this class is part of the NSF study we have previously described to you, the ground rules may&lt;br&gt;differ slightly section by section. In your section, you will start working on your assignment in discussion&lt;br&gt;section and continue working on it in next week’s discussion section. We ask that you upload a partial&lt;br&gt;solution to ICON at the end of each session (this will not be graded, it is just to see how far you get during&lt;br&gt;the discussion section). You will also be asked to answer a short survey about your experience after each&lt;br&gt;discussion section. Once you upload your final solution to ICON (when the assignment is complete),&lt;br&gt;your will be asked to fill out a separate short survey about your work on the assignment.&lt;br&gt;Just as a reminder, under no circumstances should you turn in the work of someone else (including any&lt;br&gt;code or material you may find on the Internet) as your own, nor should you share your own work with&lt;br&gt;others. It is fine, however, to discuss general concepts with your classmates as long as these discussions&lt;br&gt;do not lead to the actual exchange of code fragments or written solutions.&lt;br&gt;You hav e several sources for help. Your first recourse should always be to post your question on the ICON&lt;br&gt;discussion board. This is the fastest place to go for clarifications or disambiguation, or for help with&lt;br&gt;Python in general (remember, don’t post your solution or any part of your solution). Second, if you must&lt;br&gt;share a portion of your code, you can always attend a TA help session (see the announcement on ICON&lt;br&gt;entitled General TA Office Hours start Thursday, September 1 for times and locations). You may also&lt;br&gt;attend my office hours Tuesdays from 1:30 to 3:30 in my office (14 MLH). Finally, you may email your&lt;br&gt;code with a specific question to me or to your TA, but please be sure that you include CS1210 on the&lt;br&gt;subject line (also, this is the slowest way of getting help, due to the volume of mail we are likely to&lt;br&gt;receive).&lt;br&gt;What to Hand In&lt;br&gt;As before, for credit, you must make sure your function definitions exactly match the ‘‘signatures’’ giv en&lt;br&gt;in this problem specification. Your files should be uploaded to the HW5 dropbox folder in ICON by the&lt;br&gt;specified time and date: late assignments will not be accepted.&lt;br&gt;You should start building your solution file according to the template at the end of this assignment (the&lt;br&gt;template file, hw5.py, can be downloaded from ICON), substituting your own name for mine, obviously.&lt;br&gt;obviously. Note that the template file is incomplete and will not load in its present state.&lt;br&gt;3 Revised October 24, 2016&lt;br&gt;Make sure that you follow the instructions given for each function exactly, as the autograder expects these&lt;br&gt;functions to follow the naming convention shown. Also note the use of the comment character, #, at the&lt;br&gt;beginning of each line that is not intended to be interpreted by Python. You should use comments liberally&lt;br&gt;to explain what you are doing to the human reader.&lt;br&gt;4 Revised October 24, 2016&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;中级难度&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;主要实现了细胞生成游戏。&lt;br&gt;需要实现游戏的逻辑代码，以及界面仿真代码。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;首先：&lt;br&gt;完成代码的逻辑编写。比如活细胞和无细胞在不同的邻居个数的情况下，&lt;br&gt;下一代会是活细胞或者无细胞的判断。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;其次需要实现接口函数，来显示不同的使用策略。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Game of Life is a well-known mathematical game that gives rise to amazingly&lt;br&gt;complex behavior, although it can be specified by a few simple rules. (It is not actually a&lt;br&gt;game in the traditional sense, with players competing for a win.) Here are the rules. The&lt;br&gt;game is played on a rectangular grid. Each square on the grid can be either empty&lt;br&gt;(represented by a 0 in our version) or occupied by a “living” cell (represented by a 1). At&lt;br&gt;the beginning, you can specify empty and occupied cells in some way; then the game&lt;br&gt;runs automatically. In each generation, the next generation is computed. A new cell is&lt;br&gt;born on an empty square if it is surrounded by exactly three occupied neighbor cells. A&lt;br&gt;cell dies of overcrowding if it is surrounded by four or more living neighbors, and it dies&lt;br&gt;of loneliness if it is surrounded by zero or one living neighbor. A neighbor is an occupant&lt;br&gt;of an adjacent square to the left, right, top, or bottom or in a diagonal direction. Figure 16&lt;br&gt;shows a cell and its neighbor cells.&lt;br&gt;Many configurations show interesting behavior when subjected to these rules. Figure 17&lt;br&gt;shows a glider, observed over five generations. Note how it moves. After four&lt;br&gt;generations, it is transformed into the identical shape, but located one square to the right&lt;br&gt;and below.&lt;br&gt;One of the more amazing configurations is the glider gun: a complex collection of cells&lt;br&gt;that, after 30 moves, turns back into itself and a glider (see the large figure at the end).&lt;br&gt;Over the next two weeks, you will use Python to program the game to eliminate the&lt;br&gt;drudgery of computing successive generations by hand. Your homework assignment will&lt;br&gt;come in two parts, also known as Programming Assignment 6 and Programming&lt;br&gt;Assignment 7. The Wikipedia page on The Game of Life has a lot of useful information,&lt;br&gt;as well as some real-time examples of program behavior. You should take a look at it.&lt;br&gt;Implementing this game requires a plan for what to do about the cells at the edges of the&lt;br&gt;grid, since those cells don’t have a full complement of eight neighbors. The Wikipedia&lt;br&gt;entry does bring up this issue, and options range from simple to complex. For our&lt;br&gt;purposes, it is sufficient to assume that every square outside of the grid is empty (i.e., 0)&lt;br&gt;and will remain empty for the duration of the game.&lt;br&gt;(Much of the description above, and all the figures below, is borrowed from a textbook&lt;br&gt;by Cay Horstmann.)&lt;br&gt;Programming Assignment 6 - Game of Life, Part 1&lt;br&gt;Your solution is to be written using Python 3. Make sure you provide comments&lt;br&gt;including the file name, your name, and the date at the top of the file you submit.&lt;br&gt;Also make sure to include appropriate docstrings for all functions.&lt;br&gt;The names of your functions must exactly match the names given in this assignment.&lt;br&gt;The order of the parameters in your parameter list must exactly match the order&lt;br&gt;given in this assignment.&lt;br&gt;For any given problem below, you may want to write additional functions other&lt;br&gt;than those specified for your solution. That’s fine with us.&lt;br&gt;The  core  problem  to  be  solved  in  the  implementation  of  the  Game  of  Life  is  how  to&lt;br&gt;generate  the  next  grid  from  the  current  grid.   Your  task  is  to  write  a  function  called&lt;br&gt;nextGen  which  expects  only  one  argument.   That  argument  is  a  two-­‐dimensional&lt;br&gt;table  (i.e.,  a  list  of  lists)  with  m  rows  and  n  columns,  representing  the  current  grid.&lt;br&gt;The  elements  of  the  table  are  either  0  (empty  square)  or  1  (occupied  square).   You&lt;br&gt;may  assume  that  all  rows  have  the  same  number  of  elements.&lt;br&gt;Given  the  current  grid,  nextGen  computes  and  returns  (but  does  not  print)  a  new&lt;br&gt;next  grid  (without  altering  the  current  grid)  by  applying  the  simple  rules  provided&lt;br&gt;above.   For  example,  given  this  initial  grid:&lt;br&gt;glider = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],&lt;br&gt;[0,0,1,0,0,0,0],&lt;br&gt;[0,0,0,1,0,0,0],&lt;br&gt;[0,1,1,1,0,0,0],&lt;br&gt;[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],&lt;br&gt;[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]&lt;br&gt;your function should work like this:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = nextGen(glider)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x&lt;br&gt;[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y = nextGen(x)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y&lt;br&gt;[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; z = nextGen(y)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; z&lt;br&gt;[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; q = nextGen(z)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; q&lt;br&gt;[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]&lt;br&gt;If we formatted those results nicely, we’d see a sequence like this:&lt;br&gt;## generation 1&lt;br&gt;[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]&lt;br&gt;## generation 2&lt;br&gt;[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]&lt;br&gt;## generation 3&lt;br&gt;[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]&lt;br&gt;## generation 4&lt;br&gt;[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]&lt;br&gt;These grids correspond to the generations in Figure 17. Note that the grid passed to your&lt;br&gt;function must remain unaltered:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; glider&lt;br&gt;[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],&lt;br&gt;[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]&lt;br&gt;Where to do the assignment&lt;br&gt;You can do this assignment on your own computer, or in the labs. In either case, use the&lt;br&gt;IDLE development environment – that’s what we’ll use when we grade your program.&lt;br&gt;Put all the functions you created in a file called “prog67.py”. Save that file until you’ve&lt;br&gt;completed Programming Assignment 7.&lt;br&gt;Submitting the Assignment&lt;br&gt;Do not turn in this assignment by itself. Submit it with the work you do for Programming&lt;br&gt;Assignment 7.&lt;br&gt;Saving your work&lt;br&gt;If you are working in the lab, you will need to copy your program to your own flash-drive&lt;br&gt;or save the program to your workspace on SmartSite. To save it on flash-drive, plug the&lt;br&gt;flash-drive into the computer (your TAs or the staff in the labs can help you figure out&lt;br&gt;how), open the flash-drive, and copy your work to it by moving the folder with your files&lt;br&gt;from the Desktop onto the flash-drive. To copy the file to your SmartSite workspace, go&lt;br&gt;to Workspace, select Resources, and then use the Add button next to “My Workspace”.&lt;br&gt;Your TAs can help you with this if you run into trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

The structure of the tests&lt;br&gt;isn’t really as important as the testing plan, but we get to test both.&lt;br&gt;What to Test&lt;br&gt;We wanted to come up with a function for you to test that had a bit of everything: loops, selection, lists,&lt;br&gt;strings, dictionaries, objects, etc. But we had a bit of a conundrum. We wanted something complicated&lt;br&gt;enough to be interesting, but knew you were busy with your assignment, and didn’t want everyone to have&lt;br&gt;to spend lots of time writing a new function in order to test it.&lt;br&gt;That’s when it hit us. You’re already writing a function that you’ll probably want to test anyway…&lt;br&gt;cartesian product! It’s got everything we need, you already have to write it, and now it can help you test&lt;br&gt;your own code for A2. (A pretty smart move if I do say so myself).&lt;br&gt;How to Start&lt;br&gt;Before you start writing any code, you should think about coverage testing, and how we came up with a&lt;br&gt;test plan in lecture. Figure out all of the parameters, and the important ranges they fall into. Then write one&lt;br&gt;test for each possible combination of ranges. The goal here is to find one example test case for all possible&lt;br&gt;regions of your testing space.&lt;br&gt;Most of your actual tests will probably involve code that looks like this (now do you see why we made you&lt;br&gt;write set dict and get dict?&lt;br&gt;d1 = {…}&lt;br&gt;d2 = {…}&lt;br&gt;t1 = Table()&lt;br&gt;t2 = Table()&lt;br&gt;t1.set_dict(d1)&lt;br&gt;t2.set_dict(d2)&lt;br&gt;result_table = squeal.cartesian_product(t1, t2)&lt;br&gt;result_dict = result_table.get_dict()&lt;br&gt;expected_dict = {…}&lt;br&gt;self.assertEqual(result_dict, expected_dict)&lt;br&gt;What to Do&lt;br&gt;In a file called ex10.py, you should write a UnitTest to thoroughly test cartesian product. Your tests will&lt;br&gt;actually be run on a version of the code that I have written. Therefore, you will be doing black box testing&lt;br&gt;(you don’t know if I implemented the cartesian product or the Table class in the same way you will… in&lt;br&gt;fact, you can bet that I probably won’t). My cartesian product function will be in a file called squeal.py,&lt;br&gt;and my Table class will be in a file called database.py. Both will be placed into the same directory as your&lt;br&gt;UnitTest. We’ve provided you with some starter code, just to make sure you can access everything correctly.&lt;br&gt;What to Submit&lt;br&gt;Submit your ex10.py file to MarkUs as usual. Your UnitTest methods do not need any DocStrings, and&lt;br&gt;unless you’re doing something particularly unusual, you probably don’t need any internal comments either.&lt;br&gt;However, your method names and error messages should be descriptive enough to properly explain what&lt;br&gt;each test case does and why it’s useful. Remember that writing frivolous test cases is no better than missing&lt;br&gt;useful ones.&lt;br&gt;1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

The first 3 characters must be capital letters (A – Z) and the second 3 characters must be numeric characters (0 – 9).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b)Enter a secret word and then specify an amount of ‘right shift’ of the characters to encrypt your word. This simple method to encrypt data is attributed to Julius Caesar, the Roman Emperor. (If you are interested, you may like to read the following… &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher&lt;/a&gt;). This method takes each character in a message and replaces it with one which is a certain distance (offset) along the alphabet from it (moving right). For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . . . . . A B C D E F G H I J K L M . . . +3 A B C D E F G H I J . . . If the offset is 3 then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F etc. In this case the word DIG encrypts to GLJ. In order to decrypt the word/string, simply offset by the same amount moving in the opposite direction (i.e. moving left). Instead of restricting the cipher to the alphabetic characters only, we will use all of the printable ASCII characters. That is, all the characters from ASCII 32 (Space) to ASCII 126 (~).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; You will need to use the following two functions - ord(c) Given c, a string of length one ord(c), returns an integer representing the value of the string. For example: ord(‘a’) returns the integer 97. chr(i) Returns a string of one character whose ASCII code is the integer i. For example: chr(97) returns the string ‘a’.&lt;br&gt;c)Enter a secret sentence and create a password by taking the last letter of each word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Write a menu driven program called yourId_encryptor.py that will allow the user to enter commands and process these commands until the quit command is entered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

For example, if the user provides the path as&lt;br&gt;/home/alark/cs110/labs/lab1/lab1.py, the provided ‘path’ is actually a file.&lt;br&gt;Alternatively, /home/alark/cs110/labs/lab1/ is a directory. Use the built-in function&lt;br&gt;os.path.isfile(path) in your program to identify whether a path is a file or a directory.&lt;br&gt;• If the path is a file, check if it is a python file. Use a string function for this. Increment the&lt;br&gt;counter for python files. If the file is not a python file, increment the count for all files but not&lt;br&gt;the count for python files. Remember, your program should count the total number of files in&lt;br&gt;the directory and all its subdirectories.&lt;br&gt;• If the path is a directory, obtain a list of all the files in that directory and call your recursive&lt;br&gt;function with every element in that list. Given a path, you can obtain the list of all the files in a&lt;br&gt;directory using files = os.listdir(path).&lt;br&gt;• At the end of the program, you must display the total number of python files and the total&lt;br&gt;number of files found.&lt;br&gt;Submit to your submit directory&lt;br&gt;Using CyberDuck or your favorite file transfer program, make a directory for lab7 in your submit&lt;br&gt;directory and upload:&lt;br&gt;• recursive_dir_traversal.py&lt;br&gt;• README.txt (a text description of how your program works)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;中级难度&lt;br&gt;主要实现了利用两个class（student，grade）来存储学生成绩等信息。&lt;br&gt;Class Grade：&lt;br&gt;实现方法：&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;str&lt;/strong&gt;，&lt;strong&gt;repr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Class Student：&lt;br&gt;实现方法：&lt;br&gt;add_grade，calculate_grade，&lt;strong&gt;str&lt;/strong&gt;，&lt;strong&gt;repr&lt;/strong&gt;，&lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt;，&lt;strong&gt;lt&lt;/strong&gt;，&lt;strong&gt;eq&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;完成两个类之后，需要完成测试文件，和app应用文件来调用这两个class。&lt;br&gt;app文件：&lt;br&gt;读取对应的student文件，存入相应的类。&lt;br&gt;存所有的student 实例，并且打印出来。&lt;br&gt;test文件：&lt;br&gt;用于测试以上所有的方法。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CSE 231  Fall 2016&lt;br&gt;Computer Project #11&lt;br&gt;(Update 12/4: clarified file prompting for proj11-app.py. Update 12/2: clarified Grade &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;br&gt;Student &lt;strong&gt;str&lt;/strong&gt; requirements. Update 11/30: clarified specifications of &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;str&lt;/strong&gt; and added a&lt;br&gt;note about the sample test file).&lt;br&gt;Assignment Overview&lt;br&gt;This assignment focuses on the implementation of two Python classes to store grades of students in a&lt;br&gt;class.&lt;br&gt;It is worth 55 points (5.5% of course grade) and must be completed no later than 11:59 PM on Tuesday,&lt;br&gt;December 6.&lt;br&gt;Assignment Specifications&lt;br&gt;You will develop “Student” and “Grade” classes and implement all the methods described in the&lt;br&gt;following section.&lt;br&gt;You will demonstrate that your implementation of the classes are correct by developing a program&lt;br&gt;which serves as a test bed for that class.&lt;br&gt;You will develop an application program which uses those classes to read “students.txt” and “grades.txt”&lt;br&gt;files and store their data in instances of Student and Grade classes.&lt;br&gt;Assignment Deliverables&lt;br&gt;The deliverables for this assignment are the following files:&lt;br&gt;classes.py  – the source code for your Student and Grade classes&lt;br&gt;proj11-test.py – the source code for your test program&lt;br&gt;proj11-app.py – the source code for your application program&lt;br&gt;Be sure to use the specified file names and submit them for grading via the handin system before the&lt;br&gt;project deadline.&lt;br&gt;Specifications for Class Grade&lt;br&gt;1. The constructor (method &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;) will accept 3 values as parameters, name of the&lt;br&gt;assignment (string), grade and assignment weight (floats). All three parameters must have&lt;br&gt;default values—you choose appropriate ones. Also, the attributes cannot be private because you&lt;br&gt;need to access them in the Student class. That is, do not use double underscores in your names,&lt;br&gt;i.e. do not use an attribute name such as self.&lt;strong&gt;name.&lt;br&gt;2. The string method (&lt;/strong&gt;str&lt;strong&gt;) and representation method (&lt;/strong&gt;repr&lt;strong&gt;) should return a string&lt;br&gt;that includes the name, grade and weight of the Grade object in one line.&lt;br&gt;Specifications for Class Student&lt;br&gt;1. The constructor (method &lt;/strong&gt;init&lt;strong&gt;) will accept 4 values as parameters, student id (int), first&lt;br&gt;name (string), last name (string), and a list of all the grade objects for that student. All three&lt;br&gt;parameters must have default values—you choose appropriate ones, but the appropriate default&lt;br&gt;value for a list parameter is None, not an empty list ([]).&lt;br&gt;2. add_grade method should take a Grade object as a parameter and append it to a list of grades&lt;br&gt;for that student.&lt;br&gt;3. calculate_grade should multiply all the grade points of the student by their weight and&lt;br&gt;return the final course grade. (Each Grade object in the list has a value and weight that should be&lt;br&gt;multiplied together. The sum of all the calculations results the final weighted grade of the student&lt;br&gt;in the course)&lt;br&gt;4. The string method (&lt;/strong&gt;str&lt;strong&gt;) and representation method (&lt;/strong&gt;repr&lt;strong&gt;) should return a string&lt;br&gt;that has the student’s name (with last name first with a comma between the last name and first&lt;br&gt;name) includes all the grades of the student. This method must call the &lt;/strong&gt;str&lt;strong&gt; method of the&lt;br&gt;Grade objects. Note that implicitly calling the &lt;/strong&gt;str&lt;strong&gt; method is fine such as str() or&lt;br&gt;format(), but do not access the individual attributes such as grade.name.&lt;br&gt;5. &lt;/strong&gt;gt&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;lt&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;eq&lt;strong&gt; methods should compare the final grades of two students&lt;br&gt;together.&lt;br&gt;Note that you can use calculate_grade method to calculate the final grade of two students.&lt;br&gt;Never use “==” to check for equality of two float numbers (because floats are approximations&lt;br&gt;of real numbers). Instead, find the absolute value of the difference of two numbers; if the&lt;br&gt;difference is less than epsilon (a very small number such as 10**-6), the floats are equal to&lt;br&gt;each other (that is they are close enough to consider them to be equal). Python has an absolute&lt;br&gt;value function: abs()&lt;br&gt;Please note that you may wish to use function “print” to display various items as you are developing&lt;br&gt;your implementation of the class. However, all invocations of function “print” must be removed from&lt;br&gt;the final version of your classes (or at least turned into comments).&lt;br&gt;Hint: check the “Student” class in page 546 of the book for reference.&lt;br&gt;Specifications for the Test Program&lt;br&gt;1. You will develop a program to serve as a test bed for classes. That is, the only purpose of the&lt;br&gt;program is to demonstrate that each method of your “Student” and “Grade” classes is implemented&lt;br&gt;correctly. The source code for your test bed will be contained in the file named “proj11-test.py”. That&lt;br&gt;file will import “classes.py”. A file named “proj11-test.py” is provided as a starting template.&lt;br&gt;2. Your test bed will not perform any input operations. Instead, all test cases will be embedded in the&lt;br&gt;program itself.&lt;br&gt;3. The output produced by your test bed must be appropriately labeled so that the reader can understand&lt;br&gt;the purpose and result of each test case without examining the source code. For example, when&lt;br&gt;demonstrating &lt;/strong&gt;lt&lt;strong&gt; you might print “Demonstrating Fred &amp;lt; Mary” followed by&lt;br&gt;print(Fred&amp;lt;Mary)&lt;br&gt;Specifications for the Application Program&lt;br&gt;1. You will develop an application program which uses both classes to solve the problem described&lt;br&gt;below.&lt;br&gt;The source code for your application program will be contained in the file named “proj11-app.py”. That&lt;br&gt;file will import “classes.py”.&lt;br&gt;2. The program will attempt to access the files named “students.txt” and “grades.txt”. If any of the&lt;br&gt;input files cannot be opened, the program will display an appropriate message and halt. (Since the first&lt;br&gt;posted version of this document didn’t specify that the program must prompt for these two file names,&lt;br&gt;you have the option of prompting for them or not. However, if you prompt for them, our test program&lt;br&gt;will provide the name grades.txt to the first prompt and students.txt to the second prompt.)&lt;br&gt;3. The grades.txt file will contain three or more lines. The first line contains the weight of each&lt;br&gt;assignment, the second line contains the labels and the name of the assignments. Line 3 and subsequent&lt;br&gt;lines contain grade information for a student. Each line has a student id and all the grades of a student.&lt;br&gt;The information of each assignment should be stored in an instance of “Grade” class. A list of Grade&lt;br&gt;objects should be passed to the constructor of “Student” class.&lt;br&gt;4. The students.txt file will contain one or more lines, where each line contains the information of a&lt;br&gt;student. Each line has an id, first name and last name. That information should be stored in an instance&lt;br&gt;of “Student” class along with the list of “Grade” objects explained above.&lt;br&gt;5. The application should store all “Student” objects in a list and should print them ( print(student) ) like&lt;br&gt;the sample output provided below.&lt;br&gt;6. The application should print the class average at the end.&lt;br&gt;Assignment Notes&lt;br&gt;1. You would be wise to develop your implementation of “Student” and “Grade” classes and your test&lt;br&gt;program incrementally and in parallel. That is, implement one class method at a time and then test that&lt;br&gt;method by adding statements to your test program.&lt;br&gt;Clearly, the first class method which must be implemented and tested is the constructor (&lt;/strong&gt;init&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;br&gt;Perhaps the second class method to implement and test is &lt;/strong&gt;str__ so that you have a way to display&lt;br&gt;the value of an object of type “Student” and “Grade” using function “print”.&lt;br&gt;After implementing and testing those methods, you would continue to implement and test one method at&lt;br&gt;a time until you have completed the class.&lt;br&gt;Be sure to insert and test any necessary error handling at the appropriate time.&lt;br&gt;2. Approximately 60% of the 55 points available for the project will be allocated to the implementation&lt;br&gt;of “Student” and “Grade” classes, approximately 15% will be allocated to the test program, and&lt;br&gt;approximately 25% will be allocated to the application program.&lt;br&gt;Sample Output (Application file)&lt;br&gt;Hopper, Grace&lt;br&gt;proj01 : 75% 0.07&lt;br&gt;proj02 : 81% 0.08&lt;br&gt;proj03 : 91% 0.10&lt;br&gt;proj04 : 87% 0.10&lt;br&gt;proj05 : 73% 0.15&lt;br&gt;exam01 : 90% 0.20&lt;br&gt;exam02 : 86% 0.30&lt;br&gt;Final grade: 84%&lt;br&gt;Knuth, Donald&lt;br&gt;proj01 : 79% 0.07&lt;br&gt;proj02 : 73% 0.08&lt;br&gt;proj03 : 83% 0.10&lt;br&gt;proj04 : 87% 0.10&lt;br&gt;proj05 : 82% 0.15&lt;br&gt;exam01 : 97% 0.20&lt;br&gt;exam02 : 99% 0.30&lt;br&gt;Final grade: 89%&lt;br&gt;Goldberg, Adele&lt;br&gt;proj01 : 92% 0.07&lt;br&gt;proj02 : 82% 0.08&lt;br&gt;proj03 : 92% 0.10&lt;br&gt;proj04 : 83% 0.10&lt;br&gt;proj05 : 96% 0.15&lt;br&gt;exam01 : 92% 0.20&lt;br&gt;exam02 : 93% 0.30&lt;br&gt;Final grade: 91%&lt;br&gt;Kernighan, Brian&lt;br&gt;proj01 : 77% 0.07&lt;br&gt;proj02 : 95% 0.08&lt;br&gt;proj03 : 98% 0.10&lt;br&gt;proj04 : 87% 0.10&lt;br&gt;proj05 : 87% 0.15&lt;br&gt;exam01 : 85% 0.20&lt;br&gt;exam02 : 82% 0.30&lt;br&gt;Final grade: 86%&lt;br&gt;Liskov, Barbara&lt;br&gt;proj01 : 72% 0.07&lt;br&gt;proj02 : 82% 0.08&lt;br&gt;proj03 : 98% 0.10&lt;br&gt;proj04 : 90% 0.10&lt;br&gt;proj05 : 75% 0.15&lt;br&gt;exam01 : 98% 0.20&lt;br&gt;exam02 : 94% 0.30&lt;br&gt;Final grade: 89%&lt;br&gt;The class average is 88.17%&lt;br&gt;========================================&lt;br&gt;Educational Research&lt;br&gt;When you have completed the project insert the 5-line comment specified below.&lt;br&gt;For each of the following statements, please respond with how much they apply to your experience&lt;br&gt;completing the programming project, on the following scale:&lt;br&gt;1 = Strongly disagree / Not true of me at all&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;3&lt;br&gt;4 = Neither agree nor disagree / Somewhat true of me&lt;br&gt;5&lt;br&gt;6&lt;br&gt;7 = Strongly agree / Extremely true of me&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note that your responses to these questions will not affect your project grade, so please&lt;br&gt;answer as honestly as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Q1: Upon completing the project, I felt proud/accomplished&lt;br&gt;Q2: While working on the project, I often felt frustrated/annoyed&lt;br&gt;Q3: While working on the project, I felt inadequate/stupid&lt;br&gt;Q4: Considering the difficulty of this course, the teacher, and my skills, I think I will do well in&lt;br&gt;this course.&lt;br&gt;Please insert your answers into the bottom of your project program as a comment, formatted exactly as&lt;br&gt;follows (so we can write a program to extract them).&lt;br&gt;# Questions&lt;br&gt;# Q1: 5&lt;br&gt;# Q2: 3&lt;br&gt;# Q3: 4&lt;br&gt;# Q4: 6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

Learning Goals&lt;br&gt;Learn how to&lt;br&gt;1. use associative containers like ​std::unordered_set​ and ​std::unordered_map&lt;br&gt;2. use iterators to iterate through associative containers&lt;br&gt;3. use ​algorithms​ that are available in the C++ Standard Library&lt;br&gt;4. pass command line arguments to a C++ program&lt;br&gt;5. partition a C++ program in header files (.hpp) and source files (.cpp)&lt;br&gt;6. read, understand, and use code written by other people&lt;br&gt;2. Description&lt;br&gt;In this assignment you’ll be doing the following:&lt;br&gt;1. Read a raw text file containing movie reviews and ratings.&lt;br&gt;2. Remove the punctuations and stopwords (e.g. is, and, the, etc.) from the reviews and&lt;br&gt;write the contents to a clean review file.&lt;br&gt;3. Associate a value for all words found in the clean reviews based on the average rating of&lt;br&gt;the word.&lt;br&gt;4. Using the map between the words and their associated values, rate reviews from&lt;br&gt;another file that doesn’t have any rating already.&lt;br&gt;5. Write the ratings of the reviews to an output file.&lt;br&gt;2.1. Clean the data&lt;br&gt;The raw data with the reviews and the rating will be present in a file named&lt;br&gt;rawReviewRatings.txt​. Every review is given a rating between 0 - 4 (both inclusive). The&lt;br&gt;following are interpretation of the rating values:&lt;br&gt;● 0 = Negative&lt;br&gt;● 1 = Somewhat Negative&lt;br&gt;● 2 = Neutral&lt;br&gt;● 3 = Somewhat Positive&lt;br&gt;● 4 = Positive&lt;br&gt;Each line of review follows the following format:&lt;br&gt;&lt;rating&gt; &lt;review&gt;&lt;br&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;4 The Jungle Book is awesome!&lt;br&gt;CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016&lt;br&gt;Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj&lt;br&gt;where 4 is the rating and the text “The Jungle Book is awesome!” is the review.&lt;br&gt;Now, your first task is to read the contents of this file and ​clean the data!&lt;br&gt;The following steps needs to be performed in the same order for cleaning the data:&lt;br&gt;1. Read the raw reviews from an input file. e.g. ​rawReviewRatings.txt&lt;br&gt;2. Replace the hyphens in every line of text with spaces.&lt;br&gt;e.g. If the review contains the word “awe-inspiring”, then it should be split into 2 words&lt;br&gt;namely “awe” and “inspiring”&lt;br&gt;3. Split each line of text into multiple words using the space character as the delimiter.&lt;br&gt;e.g. “The Jungle Book is awesome!” becomes | “The” | “Jungle” | “Book” | “is” |&lt;br&gt;“awesome!” |&lt;br&gt;4. Remove the punctuation marks from the words.&lt;br&gt;e.g. “awesome!” becomes “awesome” and “!” becomes “”&lt;br&gt;5. If there are any trailing/leading whitespaces, then remove them. Remember that the&lt;br&gt;space character (‘ ’), tab (‘\t’), newline (‘\n’), etc. are considered as whitespaces. For a&lt;br&gt;complete list of whitespace characters ​this​.&lt;br&gt;e.g. “zootopia ” becomes “zootopia”, “hello\t” becomes “hello”, and “world\n” becomes&lt;br&gt;“world”&lt;br&gt;6. Remove the empty words. i.e. words with length == 0.&lt;br&gt;7. Remove single lettered words. i.e. words with length == 1.&lt;br&gt;8. Remove stopwords. e.g. is, and, the, etc. The list of stopwords can be found in the file&lt;br&gt;stopwords.txt&lt;br&gt;9. Write the contents of the clean data to a file named ​cleanReviewRatings.txt​.&lt;br&gt;2.2. Fill the dictionary&lt;br&gt;Using the ​cleanReviewRatings.txt file, create a map/dictionary for every word that is found in&lt;br&gt;this file. The dictionary is of type&lt;br&gt;​&lt;br&gt;std::unordered_map&lt;string, std::pair&lt;long,=&quot;&quot; long=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;br&gt;We associate a pair of values for each word namely its total_rating and its total_count. For&lt;br&gt;example, the word “fantastic” has occurred 3 times in the file ​cleanReviewRatings.txt with&lt;br&gt;associated ratings of 3, 4, and 3 (see the last 3 lines in the file). Therefore the word “fantastic”&lt;br&gt;gets a total_rating of 10 (i.e. 3 + 4 + 3 = 10) and a total_count of 3 since it had occurred 3 times&lt;br&gt;in the file. In a similar way, the other entries in this map are filled up as shown below. You may&lt;br&gt;want to read about a ​std::pair​ to understand more about how this map is organized.&lt;br&gt;CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016&lt;br&gt;Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj&lt;br&gt;word total_rating total_count&lt;br&gt;fantastic  10  3&lt;br&gt;Zootopia  3  1&lt;br&gt;Dory  1  1&lt;br&gt;Finding  1  1&lt;br&gt;worst  0  1&lt;br&gt;The  6  2&lt;br&gt;inspiring  2  1&lt;br&gt;Jungle  8  2&lt;br&gt;Book  8  2&lt;br&gt;good  1  1&lt;br&gt;Jack  0  1&lt;br&gt;awesome  4  1&lt;br&gt;Lion  5  2&lt;br&gt;King  5  2&lt;br&gt;awe  2  1&lt;br&gt;Jill  0  1&lt;br&gt;2.3. Rate new reviews&lt;br&gt;Using the map/dictionary that we created in the previous step, we are going to read new unrated&lt;br&gt;reviews from a file (e.g. ​rawReviews.txt​) and predict a rating for each review in this file. The&lt;br&gt;predicted rating for each review is written to an output file named ​ratings.txt​.&lt;br&gt;How do we predict the ratings for the unrated reviews?&lt;br&gt;1. Read the input file with the unrated raw reviews (e.g. ​rawReviews.txt​).&lt;br&gt;2. Clean the data and produce an output file named ​cleanReviews.txt​. The process for&lt;br&gt;cleaning the data is exactly the same as we did in step 2.1.&lt;br&gt;3. Rate each review by finding the rating for each word from the map/dictionary that we&lt;br&gt;created in step 2.2. The rating for a line of review is the average value of the rating of all&lt;br&gt;the words in the review. If some word in this unrated review is not found in the&lt;br&gt;map/dictionary, then that word is given a neutral rating of 2. If a review is empty (i.e. the&lt;br&gt;review contains no words in it), then such a review is also given a neutral rating of 2.&lt;br&gt;e.g. Let see how we computed the rating for the 2nd review in ​cleanReviews.txt (i.e.&lt;br&gt;“The Lion King fantastic”). We lookup the map/dictionary that we created before and get&lt;br&gt;the average rating for each word in this review. The average ratings of each word in this&lt;br&gt;CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016&lt;br&gt;Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj&lt;br&gt;review is shown below:&lt;br&gt;The: 6/2 = 3&lt;br&gt;Lion: 5/2 = 2.5&lt;br&gt;King: 5/2 = 2.5&lt;br&gt;fantastic: 10/3 = 3.33&lt;br&gt;Based on these individual values, this line gets and average review of 2.83 as shown in&lt;br&gt;the file ​ratings.txt​.&lt;br&gt;Rating for this line = (3 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 3.33) / 4 = 2.83&lt;br&gt;We are dividing by 4 since this review contains 4 words in total.&lt;br&gt;Another example: “Finding Nemo great”&lt;br&gt;Finding: 1&lt;br&gt;Nemo: 2 (because it is NOT found in the map)&lt;br&gt;great: 2 (because it is also NOT found in the map)&lt;br&gt;Rating for this line = (1 + 2 + 2) / 3 = 1.67&lt;br&gt;4. Write the ratings for all the reviews to an output file named ​ratings.txt​.&lt;br&gt;A high-level process diagram of the steps explained in 2.1 - 2.3 is shown. Hope this&lt;br&gt;visualization helps you to understand the idea in a better way! :)&lt;br&gt;CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016&lt;br&gt;Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj&lt;br&gt;That’s it! Now, after completing this step you may pat yourself on the back for doing an amazing&lt;br&gt;job with this assignment! :) Also, if you have not taken Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning&lt;br&gt;before then you have just now completed your first exercise in Machine Learning. You just&lt;br&gt;created a program that may predict the ratings of movie reviews based on some learning it did&lt;br&gt;before based on some reviews that already had ratings associated with them. Well, even though&lt;br&gt;our algorithm is very simple, this is the basic idea behind Machine Learning. Newcomers,&lt;br&gt;welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence! :)&lt;br&gt;3. Sample Output&lt;br&gt;If your program runs correctly without any errors, then NO OUTPUT will be written to the&lt;br&gt;console. If any input/output file cannot be opened, only then your program writes some error&lt;br&gt;messages to the console. All error handling is already taken care of in the file ​main.cpp​.&lt;br&gt;3.1.

Important Details&lt;br&gt;1. The code for this assignment is split across 5 files.&lt;br&gt;a. main.cpp&lt;br&gt;b. a2.hpp&lt;br&gt;c. a2.cpp​ (This is the ONLY file you should modify!)&lt;br&gt;d. trim.hpp&lt;br&gt;e. trim.cpp&lt;br&gt;The .hpp files are the header files which contain only the declaration of the functions and&lt;br&gt;the .cpp files are the source files which contain the implementation of these functions. If&lt;br&gt;you want to understand more about why we have separate header and source files, then&lt;br&gt;maybe you should read ​this​.&lt;br&gt;2. Take some time to read the source code starting from the main() function that is present&lt;br&gt;inside the file main.cpp.&lt;br&gt;3. All the code you write for this assignment will only be inside the file ​a2.cpp. You should&lt;br&gt;not perform any file IO, print to stdout, or print to stderr in a2.cpp.&lt;br&gt;4. The files trim.hpp and trim.cpp are provided only to help you with trimming the&lt;br&gt;whitespaces in strings since doing so in C++ is not so easy as it’s in Java. You may read&lt;br&gt;these files to find out how to trim strings for this assignment.&lt;br&gt;5. You should use the following command to ​compile​​ your program.&lt;br&gt;CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016&lt;br&gt;Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj&lt;br&gt;$ g++ &lt;em&gt;.cpp -std=c++11&lt;br&gt;where &lt;/em&gt;.cpp means all the .cpp files are to be compiled. You need not mention the&lt;br&gt;names of the .hpp files since they are included from within the .cpp files. The option&lt;br&gt;“-std=c++11” informs the compiler that our may contain C++11 features (e.g.&lt;br&gt;std::unordered_map was introduced only in C++11).&lt;br&gt;6. Your program takes the two files ​rawReviewRatings.txt and ​rawReviews.txt as ​command&lt;br&gt;line arguments​. ​​You should run your program as shown below:&lt;br&gt;$ ./a.out rawReviewRatings.txt rawReviews.txt&lt;br&gt;If you don’t give these 2 command line arguments to your program, then the following&lt;br&gt;error message will be printed. This error handling is already handled for you in main.cpp.&lt;br&gt;$ ./a.out&lt;br&gt;USAGE: ./a.out &lt;reviewratingsfile&gt; &lt;reviewsfile&gt;&lt;br&gt;7. If your program works correctly without any errors, then nothing is printed to the console.&lt;br&gt;Only the three output files cleanReviewRatings.txt, cleanReviews.txt and ratings.txt will&lt;br&gt;be produced. You may even try compiling and running your program before adding any&lt;br&gt;code in a2.cpp to see if these 3 output files are produced. The contents of these output&lt;br&gt;files will be empty until the methods in a2.cpp are implemented.&lt;br&gt;8. You should NOT add any new functions/methods in a2.cpp.&lt;br&gt;9. You ​SHOULD NOT MODIFY​​ any of the following in a2.cpp:&lt;br&gt;a. Names of the functions&lt;br&gt;b. Names and types of the parameters to a function.&lt;br&gt;c. Return types of the functions.&lt;br&gt;10.An approximate number of lines of code is given for each function in a2.cpp. These are&lt;br&gt;the number of lines for each function in Gerald’s implementation of a2.cpp. We have&lt;br&gt;provided this information since it may help you to see how little code you may write if you&lt;br&gt;make use of the C++ Standard Library effectively. This would help you to stop and think&lt;br&gt;for a while before you may write a lot of code by yourself and maybe later realize that&lt;br&gt;you could have used some functionality from the standard library to do the same thing&lt;br&gt;with little code and more effectively!&lt;br&gt;11.Updates to this specification that may be posted on piazza are also part of this&lt;br&gt;specification.&lt;br&gt;CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016&lt;br&gt;Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj&lt;br&gt;5.

Learning Goals&lt;br&gt;Learn how to&lt;br&gt;1. use associative containers like ​std::unordered_set​ and ​std::unordered_map&lt;br&gt;2. use iterators to iterate through associative containers&lt;br&gt;3. use ​algorithms​ that are available in the C++ Standard Library&lt;br&gt;4. pass command line arguments to a C++ program&lt;br&gt;5. partition a C++ program in header files (.hpp) and source files (.cpp)&lt;br&gt;6. read, understand, and use code written by other people&lt;br&gt;2. Description&lt;br&gt;In this assignment you’ll be doing the following:&lt;br&gt;1. Read a raw text file containing movie reviews and ratings.&lt;br&gt;2. Remove the punctuations and stopwords (e.g. is, and, the, etc.) from the reviews and&lt;br&gt;write the contents to a clean review file.&lt;br&gt;3. Associate a value for all words found in the clean reviews based on the average rating of&lt;br&gt;the word.&lt;br&gt;4. Using the map between the words and their associated values, rate reviews from&lt;br&gt;another file that doesn’t have any rating already.&lt;br&gt;5. Write the ratings of the reviews to an output file.&lt;br&gt;2.1. Clean the data&lt;br&gt;The raw data with the reviews and the rating will be present in a file named&lt;br&gt;rawReviewRatings.txt​. Every review is given a rating between 0 - 4 (both inclusive). The&lt;br&gt;following are interpretation of the rating values:&lt;br&gt;● 0 = Negative&lt;br&gt;● 1 = Somewhat Negative&lt;br&gt;● 2 = Neutral&lt;br&gt;● 3 = Somewhat Positive&lt;br&gt;● 4 = Positive&lt;br&gt;Each line of review follows the following format:&lt;br&gt;&lt;rating&gt; &lt;review&gt;&lt;br&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;4 The Jungle Book is awesome!&lt;br&gt;CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016&lt;br&gt;Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj&lt;br&gt;where 4 is the rating and the text “The Jungle Book is awesome!” is the review.&lt;br&gt;Now, your first task is to read the contents of this file and ​clean the data!&lt;br&gt;The following steps needs to be performed in the same order for cleaning the data:&lt;br&gt;1. Read the raw reviews from an input file. e.g. ​rawReviewRatings.txt&lt;br&gt;2. Replace the hyphens in every line of text with spaces.&lt;br&gt;e.g. If the review contains the word “awe-inspiring”, then it should be split into 2 words&lt;br&gt;namely “awe” and “inspiring”&lt;br&gt;3. Split each line of text into multiple words using the space character as the delimiter.&lt;br&gt;e.g. “The Jungle Book is awesome!” becomes | “The” | “Jungle” | “Book” | “is” |&lt;br&gt;“awesome!” |&lt;br&gt;4. Remove the punctuation marks from the words.&lt;br&gt;e.g. “awesome!” becomes “awesome” and “!” becomes “”&lt;br&gt;5. If there are any trailing/leading whitespaces, then remove them. Remember that the&lt;br&gt;space character (‘ ’), tab (‘\t’), newline (‘\n’), etc. are considered as whitespaces. For a&lt;br&gt;complete list of whitespace characters ​this​.&lt;br&gt;e.g. “zootopia ” becomes “zootopia”, “hello\t” becomes “hello”, and “world\n” becomes&lt;br&gt;“world”&lt;br&gt;6. Remove the empty words. i.e. words with length == 0.&lt;br&gt;7. Remove single lettered words. i.e. words with length == 1.&lt;br&gt;8. Remove stopwords. e.g. is, and, the, etc. The list of stopwords can be found in the file&lt;br&gt;stopwords.txt&lt;br&gt;9. Write the contents of the clean data to a file named ​cleanReviewRatings.txt​.&lt;br&gt;2.2. Fill the dictionary&lt;br&gt;Using the ​cleanReviewRatings.txt file, create a map/dictionary for every word that is found in&lt;br&gt;this file. The dictionary is of type&lt;br&gt;​&lt;br&gt;std::unordered_map&lt;string, std::pair&lt;long,=&quot;&quot; long=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;br&gt;We associate a pair of values for each word namely its total_rating and its total_count. For&lt;br&gt;example, the word “fantastic” has occurred 3 times in the file ​cleanReviewRatings.txt with&lt;br&gt;associated ratings of 3, 4, and 3 (see the last 3 lines in the file). Therefore the word “fantastic”&lt;br&gt;gets a total_rating of 10 (i.e. 3 + 4 + 3 = 10) and a total_count of 3 since it had occurred 3 times&lt;br&gt;in the file. In a similar way, the other entries in this map are filled up as shown below. You may&lt;br&gt;want to read about a ​std::pair​ to understand more about how this map is organized.&lt;br&gt;CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016&lt;br&gt;Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj&lt;br&gt;word total_rating total_count&lt;br&gt;fantastic  10  3&lt;br&gt;Zootopia  3  1&lt;br&gt;Dory  1  1&lt;br&gt;Finding  1  1&lt;br&gt;worst  0  1&lt;br&gt;The  6  2&lt;br&gt;inspiring  2  1&lt;br&gt;Jungle  8  2&lt;br&gt;Book  8  2&lt;br&gt;good  1  1&lt;br&gt;Jack  0  1&lt;br&gt;awesome  4  1&lt;br&gt;Lion  5  2&lt;br&gt;King  5  2&lt;br&gt;awe  2  1&lt;br&gt;Jill  0  1&lt;br&gt;2.3. Rate new reviews&lt;br&gt;Using the map/dictionary that we created in the previous step, we are going to read new unrated&lt;br&gt;reviews from a file (e.g. ​rawReviews.txt​) and predict a rating for each review in this file. The&lt;br&gt;predicted rating for each review is written to an output file named ​ratings.txt​.&lt;br&gt;How do we predict the ratings for the unrated reviews?&lt;br&gt;1.

Rate each review by finding the rating for each word from the map/dictionary that we&lt;br&gt;created in step 2.2. The rating for a line of review is the average value of the rating of all&lt;br&gt;the words in the review. If some word in this unrated review is not found in the&lt;br&gt;map/dictionary, then that word is given a neutral rating of 2. If a review is empty (i.e. the&lt;br&gt;review contains no words in it), then such a review is also given a neutral rating of 2.&lt;br&gt;e.g. Let see how we computed the rating for the 2nd review in ​cleanReviews.txt (i.e.&lt;br&gt;“The Lion King fantastic”). We lookup the map/dictionary that we created before and get&lt;br&gt;the average rating for each word in this review. The average ratings of each word in this&lt;br&gt;CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016&lt;br&gt;Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj&lt;br&gt;review is shown below:&lt;br&gt;The: 6/2 = 3&lt;br&gt;Lion: 5/2 = 2.5&lt;br&gt;King: 5/2 = 2.5&lt;br&gt;fantastic: 10/3 = 3.33&lt;br&gt;Based on these individual values, this line gets and average review of 2.83 as shown in&lt;br&gt;the file ​ratings.txt​.&lt;br&gt;Rating for this line = (3 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 3.33) / 4 = 2.83&lt;br&gt;We are dividing by 4 since this review contains 4 words in total.&lt;br&gt;Another example: “Finding Nemo great”&lt;br&gt;Finding: 1&lt;br&gt;Nemo: 2 (because it is NOT found in the map)&lt;br&gt;great: 2 (because it is also NOT found in the map)&lt;br&gt;Rating for this line = (1 + 2 + 2) / 3 = 1.67&lt;br&gt;4.

    <content type="html">&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;完成一个简单的学生管理系统，包括增删改查学信息的功能，保存到数据库，统计和记录学生成绩&lt;br&gt;等等相关操作，输入java入门级的作业&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2&lt;br&gt;14 September 2016 1&lt;br&gt;A Simple Student Management System&lt;br&gt;Due Date : 12 noon on Friday in Week 12 (21st Oct 2016)&lt;br&gt;Introduction&lt;br&gt;This assignment is worth 25% of the marks for your final assessment in this unit. Heavy penalties will&lt;br&gt;apply for late submission. This is an individual assignment and must be entirely your own work. You must&lt;br&gt;attribute the source of any part of your code which you have not written yourself. Please note the section on&lt;br&gt;plagiarism in this document.&lt;br&gt;The assignment must be done using the BlueJ environment. All user input to the system, and system&lt;br&gt;output to the user, must be done at the BlueJ terminal window. No other graphical interfaces are to be&lt;br&gt;used (nor assessed) in your program.&lt;br&gt;The Java source code for this assignment must be implemented according to the FIT9131 Java Coding&lt;br&gt;Standards.&lt;br&gt;Any points needing clarification should be discussed with your tutor in the tutorial class. You should not&lt;br&gt;make any assumptions about the program without consulting with your tutor.&lt;br&gt;Specification&lt;br&gt;For this assignment you are required to write a program that implements a simple Student Management&lt;br&gt;System for a very small, fictional, school. This section specifies the required functionality of the program.&lt;br&gt;The aim of the Student Management System is for a user (the school’s enrolment staff) to keep a database of&lt;br&gt;the students enrolled in various subjects in this fictional school. This school only offers three (3) subjects :&lt;br&gt;Computing, Maths, and English. The system will allow the user to add/delete students, enrol them in&lt;br&gt;subjects, and perform simple reports.&lt;br&gt;Even though this program is functionally very different from the program you wrote in Assignment 1, you&lt;br&gt;should be able to re-use much of your previous code here - if you have designed the classes/logic in your&lt;br&gt;previous program properly. This is one of the major benefits of an object-oriented program - the ability to&lt;br&gt;re-use classes.&lt;br&gt;The Student Management System should provide the following features :&lt;br&gt; maintains a list (using a Java Collection class) of Student objects&lt;br&gt;o each Student object represents a person who is allowed to enrol in the fictional school&lt;br&gt; maintains a fixed list of exactly 3 Subject objects&lt;br&gt;o each Subject object represents a subject which is available in the fictional school&lt;br&gt;FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2&lt;br&gt;14 September 2016 2&lt;br&gt; enrol each student in a subject, or subjects (HD level)&lt;br&gt; lists the details of an existing student&lt;br&gt; produces a report of students based on some criteria&lt;br&gt; loads a list of students (with their enrolled subjects) from a text file&lt;br&gt; saves the list of current students (with their enrolled subjects) to a text file&lt;br&gt;You are to demonstrate the following programming techniques in your program :&lt;br&gt; reading/writing data from/to text files&lt;br&gt; using appropriate Java Collection class or classes to store data&lt;br&gt; using code to manipulate the data in the collection(s)&lt;br&gt; performing simple searches, filtered by some given criteria&lt;br&gt; using program constructs such as repetitions &amp;amp; selections&lt;br&gt; using appropriate classes to represent objects in the program&lt;br&gt;There will be a description of the “HD level” features later in this document (in the Grades section).&lt;br&gt;You are also required to produce a partial Test Strategy for your program.&lt;br&gt;FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2&lt;br&gt;14 September 2016 3&lt;br&gt;Program Logic&lt;br&gt;When the Student Management System starts, it should automatically load a text file called&lt;br&gt;“students.txt” which contains details of all students currently stored in the system. The actual format&lt;br&gt;of this text file is described later in this document. The data loaded should be stored in some appropriate data&lt;br&gt;structures. No other reading from or writing to file is required while the program is in operation, until the&lt;br&gt;user chooses to exit, at which point the program saves all the data in memory back to the same text file&lt;br&gt;(students.txt).&lt;br&gt;In other words, the file I/O operations are performed automatically by the program, and require no&lt;br&gt;interactions with the user.&lt;br&gt;When the program is running, it should repeatedly display a menu with these options :&lt;br&gt;(1) Add new student&lt;br&gt;(2) Delete a student&lt;br&gt;(3) Find Student By Name&lt;br&gt;(4) List Students By Subject&lt;br&gt;(5) List All Students&lt;br&gt;(6) Exit System&lt;br&gt;Option (1) allows the user to add a new student into the database. The user should be asked for the student’s&lt;br&gt;details, plus what subject to “enrol” him/her in.&lt;br&gt;Option (2) allows the user to remove an existing student from the database.&lt;br&gt;Option (3) allows the user to find an existing student in the database. The user should be asked to enter a&lt;br&gt;name to search for. If a matching student is found, his/her details will be displayed.&lt;br&gt;Option (4) allows the user to display a list of students enrolled in a subject. The user should be asked for a&lt;br&gt;subject name; a list of all students (if any) enrolled in that subject should then be displayed.&lt;br&gt;Option (5) allows the user to display a list of all students enrolled in the school.&lt;br&gt;Option (6) exits the program. All the students currently in memory are automatically saved to&lt;br&gt;“students.txt”.&lt;br&gt;Inputs other than 1-6 should be rejected, and an error message printed. The menu should be displayed&lt;br&gt;repeatedly, until the user chooses Option (6).&lt;br&gt;FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2&lt;br&gt;14 September 2016 4&lt;br&gt;Important Assumptions&lt;br&gt;You should observe the following assumptions when implementing your program :&lt;br&gt; all student names are unique - if a student is already in the database, trying to add the same name&lt;br&gt;again should generate an error&lt;br&gt; there is no limit to how many students can be enrolled&lt;br&gt; exactly 3 subjects are offered : Computing, Maths and English&lt;br&gt; each student can only enrol in exactly one subject&lt;br&gt; all searches use exact matches (eg. “andy” will not match “andy cheng”); however, the search&lt;br&gt;strings are not case-sensitive (eg. “Sue Smith” is considered to be the same as “SUE smith”)&lt;br&gt; the data file is always in the correct format - ie. no need to validate the data when reading it in&lt;br&gt;Student Record Format&lt;br&gt;Each student in the database contains the following information :&lt;br&gt; Name (non-blank String, may contain multiple words)&lt;br&gt; Telephone (non-blank String, exactly 9 digits, 1st digit must be a ‘9’)&lt;br&gt; Subject (a String, representing one of the 3 subjects offered)&lt;br&gt;Input File Format&lt;br&gt;The input data file (students.txt) has the following format for each line :&lt;br&gt;Name,Telephone,Subject  (the fields are separated by commas)&lt;br&gt;Eg.&lt;br&gt;David Smith,912345678,Maths&lt;br&gt;Andy Cheng,987654321,Computing&lt;br&gt;Susan Dally,911221122,English&lt;br&gt;Zak Whatever,999999999,Maths&lt;br&gt;Russell Crowe,980808080,Computing&lt;br&gt;FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2&lt;br&gt;14 September 2016 5&lt;br&gt;Program Design&lt;br&gt;Your program must demonstrate your understanding of the object-oriented concepts and general&lt;br&gt;programming constructs presented in FIT9131. You must use appropriate data structures to store the various&lt;br&gt;objects (list of students, list of subjects, etc) in the program.&lt;br&gt;You must be able to justify the choice of the data structures during your interview. You must document any&lt;br&gt;additional assumptions you made.&lt;br&gt;Validation of values for fields and local variables should also be implemented. You should not allow an&lt;br&gt;object of a class to be set to an invalid state.&lt;br&gt;Discuss with your tutor regarding what classes are appropriate, and how they interact with each other.&lt;br&gt;The main requirements are : (1) the Students and Subjects must be implemented as objects, and they must&lt;br&gt;be stored in some appropriate Java collections, and (2) for the HD level , the list of Subjects within each&lt;br&gt;Student object must also be stored in some appropriate Java collections.&lt;br&gt;Your program must deal with invalid values entered by the user in a sensible manner. For instance, if a user&lt;br&gt;enters “abc” instead of a number for the menu options, your program should not crash.&lt;br&gt;All on-screen input/output should be formatted in a user-friendly manner. Sensible error messages should be&lt;br&gt;displayed whenever appropriate (eg. when searching for a student who is not in the database, trying to enrol&lt;br&gt;student in a subject which does not exist, etc).&lt;br&gt;Grades&lt;br&gt;There are 2 possible Grade Categories for this assignment, as described below :&lt;br&gt;1) A maximum grade of up to a D (Distinction) can be achieved by correctly implementing all the&lt;br&gt;features as described in the “Program Logic” section above.&lt;br&gt;2) To achieve up to a maximum of a HD (High Distinction), you need to implement the following&lt;br&gt;additional features :&lt;br&gt; for Option (1), a student can be enrolled in up to a maximum of 3 unique subjects&lt;br&gt; for Option (4), the user can specify more than 1 subject, and the program will display all&lt;br&gt;students listed in those subjects (eg. all students enrolled in both “Computing” AND “English”,&lt;br&gt;all students enrolled in “Computing” AND “Maths” AND “English”, etc)&lt;br&gt;Note : The description of the program’s logic/design is intentionally left vague, to give you some room&lt;br&gt;to exercise your own design and creativity. Discuss with your tutor about what/how to implement.&lt;br&gt;Important : You must not attempt the HD Category until you have fully implemented the D&lt;br&gt;Category. If you submit a program which partially implements both, you will only be awarded up&lt;br&gt;to a maximum of D.&lt;br&gt;FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2&lt;br&gt;14 September 2016 6&lt;br&gt;Test Strategy&lt;br&gt;For this assignment, you are required to produce a partial Test Strategy for the program.&lt;br&gt;There is no need to produce Test Strategy for any other classes you have used in your program.&lt;br&gt;You must provide a Test Plan, plus detailed sets of Test Data, Expected Results and Actual Results for the&lt;br&gt;Student class.&lt;br&gt;Assessment&lt;br&gt;Assessment for this assignment will be done via an interview with your tutor. The marks will be allocated as&lt;br&gt;follows:&lt;br&gt; Test Strategy : 10%&lt;br&gt; Java Code &amp;amp; Object-Oriented Design : 35%&lt;br&gt; Program Functionality in accordance with the requirements : 55%&lt;br&gt;You must submit your work by the submission deadline on the due date (a late penalty of 20% per day of&lt;br&gt;the possible marks will apply).&lt;br&gt;Marks will be deducted for untidy submissions and non-conformances to the FIT9131 Java Coding&lt;br&gt;Standards.&lt;br&gt;Interview&lt;br&gt;You will be asked to demonstrate your program at an interview following the submission date. At the&lt;br&gt;interview you can also expect to be asked to explain your code, your design, discuss design decisions and&lt;br&gt;alternatives and modify your code as required. Marks will not be awarded for any section of code or&lt;br&gt;functionality that a student cannot explain satisfactorily. (The marker may delete excessive comments in&lt;br&gt;code before a student is asked to explain that code).&lt;br&gt;In other words, you will be assessed on your understanding of the code, and not on the actual code itself.&lt;br&gt;Interview times will be arranged in the tutorial labs in Week 12. It is your responsibility to attend the lab and&lt;br&gt;arrange an interview time with your tutor. Any student who does not attend an interview will receive a mark&lt;br&gt;of 0 for the assignment.&lt;br&gt;The actual interviews will take place in Week 13.&lt;br&gt;Your Test Strategy will be only for one class - the Student class.&lt;br&gt;FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2&lt;br&gt;14 September 2016 7&lt;br&gt;Submission Requirements&lt;br&gt;The assignment must be uploaded to Moodle on or before the due date. The link to upload the assignment&lt;br&gt;will be made available in the Assignments section of the unit’s Moodle site before the submission deadline.&lt;br&gt;The submission requirements are as follows:&lt;br&gt;A .zip file uploaded to Moodle containing the following components:&lt;br&gt; the BlueJ project you created to implement your assignment. The .zip should be named with your&lt;br&gt;Student ID Number. For example, if your id is 12345678, then the file should be named&lt;br&gt;12345678_A2.zip. Do not name your file any other way.&lt;br&gt; it is your responsibility to check that your ZIP file contains all the correct files, and is not corrupted,&lt;br&gt;before you submit it. If you tutor cannot open your zip file, or if it does not contain the correct files,&lt;br&gt;you will not be assessed.&lt;br&gt; an MS Word document containing your Test Strategy for the Student class.  (Note: The JUnit facility in&lt;br&gt;BlueJ is NOT to be used for this assignment)&lt;br&gt; a completed Assignment Cover Sheet. This will be available for download from the unit’s Moodle site&lt;br&gt;before the submission deadline. You simply complete the editable sections of the document, save it, and&lt;br&gt;include it in your .zip file for submission.&lt;br&gt;Marks will be deducted for failure to comply with any of these requirements.&lt;br&gt;Warning : there will be no extensions to the due date. Any late submission will incur the 20% per day&lt;br&gt;penalty. It is strongly suggested that you submit the assignment well before the deadline, in case there are&lt;br&gt;some unexpected complications on the day (eg. interruptions to your home internet connection).&lt;br&gt;Plagiarism&lt;br&gt;Cheating and plagiarism are viewed as serious offences. In cases where cheating has been confirmed,&lt;br&gt;students have been severely penalised, from losing all marks for an assignment, to facing disciplinary action&lt;br&gt;at the Faculty level. Monash has several policies in relation to these offences and it is your responsibility to&lt;br&gt;acquaint yourself with these.&lt;br&gt;Plagiarism (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.policy.monash.edu/policybank/academic/education/conduct/plagiarism-policy.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;http://www.policy.monash.edu/policybank/academic/education/conduct/plagiarism-policy.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;Discipline: Student Policy (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.policy.monash.edu/policy-&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;http://www.policy.monash.edu/policy-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;bank/academic/education/conduct/student-discipline-policy.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;java的网络编程，完成状态路由协议，本题主要考察java基础，网络编程基础，设计路由协议，Dijkstra’s算法&lt;br&gt;，UDP套接字协议，动态路由等等知识，分为2个part&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMP 3331/9331: Computer Networks &amp;amp; Applications&lt;br&gt;Programming Assignment 2: Link State Routing&lt;br&gt;Due Date: 28 Oct 2016, 11:59 pm (Week 13) Marks: 10 + 1 bonus&lt;br&gt;1. Change Log&lt;br&gt;Version 1.0 released on 19 th September 2016.&lt;br&gt;2. Goal and Learning Objectives&lt;br&gt;In this assignment your task is to implement the link state routing protocol. Your program will be&lt;br&gt;running at all nodes in the specified network. At each node the input to your program is a set of&lt;br&gt;directly attached nodes (i.e. neighbours) and the costs of these links. Each node will broadcast&lt;br&gt;link-state packets to all other nodes in the network. Your routing program at each node should&lt;br&gt;report the least-cost path and the associated cost to all other nodes in the network. Your program&lt;br&gt;should be able to deal with failed nodes.&lt;br&gt;2.1 Learning Objectives&lt;br&gt;On completing this assignment you will gain sufficient expertise in the following skills:&lt;br&gt;• Designing a routing protocol&lt;br&gt;• Link state (Dijkstra’s) algorithm&lt;br&gt;• UDP socket programming&lt;br&gt;• Handling routing dynamics&lt;br&gt;3. Assignment Specification&lt;br&gt;This section gives detailed specifications of the assignment. You can receive 1 bonus mark for&lt;br&gt;submitting the assignment 1 week prior to the deadline.&lt;br&gt;3.1 Implementation Details&lt;br&gt;In this assignment, you will implement the link state routing protocol.&lt;br&gt;The program will accept the following command line arguments:&lt;br&gt;• NODE_ID, the ID for this node. This argument must be a single uppercase alphabet (e.g., A,&lt;br&gt;B, etc).&lt;br&gt;• NODE_PORT, the port number on which this node will send and receive packets to and from&lt;br&gt;its neighbours.&lt;br&gt;Updates to the assignment, including any corrections and clarifications, will be posted on the&lt;br&gt;subject website. Please make sure that you check the subject website regularly for updates.&lt;br&gt;• CONFIG.TXT, this file will contain the costs to the neighbouring nodes. It will also contain&lt;br&gt;the port number being used by each neighbour for exchanging routing packets. An example of&lt;br&gt;this file is provided below.&lt;br&gt;Since we can’t let you play with real network routers, the routing programs for all the nodes in the&lt;br&gt;simulated network will run on a single desktop machine. However, each instance of the routing&lt;br&gt;protocol (corresponding to each node in the network) will be listening on a different port number.&lt;br&gt;If your routing software executes correctly on a single desktop machine, it should also work&lt;br&gt;correctly on real network routers. Note that, the terms router and node are used interchangeably in&lt;br&gt;the rest of this specification.&lt;br&gt;Assume that the routing protocol is being instantiated for a node A, with two neighbours B and C.&lt;br&gt;A simple example of how the routing program would be executed (assuming it is a Java program&lt;br&gt;named Lsr.java) follows:&lt;br&gt;java Lsr A 2000 config.txt&lt;br&gt;where the config.txt would be as follows:&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;B 5 2001&lt;br&gt;C 7 2002&lt;br&gt;The first line of this file indicates the number of neighbours (NOT the total number of nodes in the&lt;br&gt;network). Following this there is one line dedicated to each neighbour. It starts with the neighbour&lt;br&gt;id, followed by the cost to reach this neighbour and finally the port number that this neighbour is&lt;br&gt;using for communication. For example, the second line in the config.txt above indicates that the&lt;br&gt;cost to neighbour B is 5 and this neighbour is using port number 2001 for receiving and&lt;br&gt;transmitting link-state packets. The node ids will be uppercase alphabets and you can assume that&lt;br&gt;there will be no more than 10 nodes in the test scenarios. However, do not make assumptions that&lt;br&gt;the node ids will necessarily start from the letter A or that they will always be in sequence. The&lt;br&gt;link costs should be floating point numbers (up to the first decimal) and the port numbers should&lt;br&gt;be integers. These three fields will be separated by a single white space between two successive&lt;br&gt;fields in each line of the configuration file. The link costs will be static and will not change once&lt;br&gt;initialised. Further, the link costs will be consistent in both directions, i.e., if the cost from A to B&lt;br&gt;is 5, then the link from B to A will also have a cost of 5. You may assume that the configuration&lt;br&gt;files used for marking will be consistent with the above description and devoid of any errors.&lt;br&gt;Important: It is worth restating that initially each node is only aware of the costs to its direct&lt;br&gt;neighbours. The nodes do not have global knowledge (i.e. information about the entire network&lt;br&gt;topology) at start-up.&lt;br&gt;The remainder of the specification is divided into two parts, beginning with the base specification&lt;br&gt;as the first part and the subsequent part adding new functionality to the base specification. In order&lt;br&gt;to receive full marks for this assignment you must implement both parts. If you are unable to&lt;br&gt;complete the second part, you will still receive marks for the first part. (The marking guidelines at&lt;br&gt;the end of the specification indicate the distribution of marks).&lt;br&gt;Part 1: Base Specification&lt;br&gt;In link-state routing, each node broadcasts link-state packets to all other nodes in the network, with&lt;br&gt;each link-state packet containing the identities of the node’s neighbours and the associated costs to&lt;br&gt;reach them. You must implement a simple broadcasting mechanism in your program. Upon&lt;br&gt;initialisation, each node creates a link-state packet (containing the appropriate information – see&lt;br&gt;description of link-state protocol in the textbook/lecture notes) and sends this packet to all direct&lt;br&gt;neighbours. The exact format of the link-state packets that you will use is left for you to decide.&lt;br&gt;Upon receiving this link-state packet, each neighbouring router in turn broadcasts this packet to its&lt;br&gt;own neighbours (excluding the router from which it received this link-state packet in the first&lt;br&gt;place). This simple flooding mechanism will ensure that each link-state packet is propagated&lt;br&gt;through the entire network.&lt;br&gt;It is possible that some nodes may start earlier than their neighbours. As a result, a node might&lt;br&gt;send the link-state packet to a neighbour, which has not run yet. You should not worry about this&lt;br&gt;since the routing program at each node will repeatedly send the link-state packet to its neighbours&lt;br&gt;and a slow-starting neighbour will eventually get the information. That said, when we test your&lt;br&gt;assignment, we would ensure that all nodes are initiated simultaneously (using a script).&lt;br&gt;Each node should periodically broadcast the link-state packet to its neighbours every&lt;br&gt;UPDATE_INTERVAL. You should set this interval to 1 second. In other words, a node should&lt;br&gt;broadcast a link state packet every second.&lt;br&gt;Real routing protocols use UDP for exchanging control packets. Hence, you MUST use UDP as&lt;br&gt;the transport protocol for exchanging link-state packets amongst the neighbours. Note that, each&lt;br&gt;router can consult its configuration file to determine the port numbers used by its neighbours for&lt;br&gt;exchanging link-state packets. Do not worry about the unreliable nature of UDP. Since, you are&lt;br&gt;simulating multiple routers on a single machine, it is highly unlikely that link-state packets will be&lt;br&gt;dropped. Furthermore, since link-state packets are broadcast periodically, occasional packet loss&lt;br&gt;will not impact the operation of your protocol. If you use TCP, a significant penalty will be&lt;br&gt;assessed.&lt;br&gt;On receiving link-state packets from all other nodes, a router can build up a global view of the&lt;br&gt;network topology. You may want to review your class notes and consult standard data structures&lt;br&gt;textbooks for standard representations of undirected graphs, which would be an appropriate way to&lt;br&gt;model this view of the network.&lt;br&gt;Given a view of the entire network topology, a router should run Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute&lt;br&gt;least-cost paths to all other routers within the network. Each node should wait for a&lt;br&gt;ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL (the default value is 30 seconds) since start-up and then execute&lt;br&gt;Dijkstra’s algorithm. Given that there will be no more than 10 nodes in the network and a periodic&lt;br&gt;link-state broadcast frequency of 1 second, 30 seconds is a sufficiently long duration for each node&lt;br&gt;to discover the global view of the entire topology.&lt;br&gt;Once a router finishes running Dijkstra’s algorithm, it should print out to the terminal, the least-&lt;br&gt;cost path to each destination node (excluding itself) along with the cost of this path. The following&lt;br&gt;is an example output for node A in some arbitrary network:&lt;br&gt;least-cost path to node B: ACB and the cost is 10&lt;br&gt;least-cost path to node C: AC and the cost is 2.5&lt;br&gt;We will wait for duration of ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL after running your program for the&lt;br&gt;output to appear (some extra time will be added as a buffer). If the output does not appear within&lt;br&gt;this time, you will be heavily penalised. As indicated earlier, we will restrict the size of the&lt;br&gt;network to 10 nodes in the test topologies. The default value of 30 seconds is sufficiently long for&lt;br&gt;all the nodes to receive link-state packets from every other node and compute the least-cost paths.&lt;br&gt;Your program should execute forever (as a loop). In other words, each node should keep&lt;br&gt;broadcasting link-state packets every UPDATE_INTERVAL and Dijkstra’s algorithm should be&lt;br&gt;executed and the output printed out every ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL. To kill an instance of&lt;br&gt;the routing protocol, the user should type CTRL-C at the respective terminal.&lt;br&gt;Restricting Link-state Broadcasts: Note that, a naïve broadcast strategy; wherein each node&lt;br&gt;retransmits every link state packet that it receives will result in unnecessary broadcasts and thus&lt;br&gt;increase the overhead. To elaborate this issue, consider the example topology discussed in the&lt;br&gt;latter part of the spec. The link-state packet created by node A will be sent to its direct neighbours&lt;br&gt;B, C and D. Each of these three nodes will in turn broadcast this link-state packet to their&lt;br&gt;neighbours. Let us consider Node C, which broadcasts A’s link state packet to B, D, E and F. Note&lt;br&gt;that node B has already broadcast A’s link state packet once (when it received it directly from A).&lt;br&gt;Node B has now received this same link-state packet via node C. There should thus be no need for&lt;br&gt;node B to broadcast this packet again. You MUST implement a mechanism to reduce such&lt;br&gt;unnecessary broadcasts. This can be achieved in several ways. You are open to choose any method&lt;br&gt;to achieve this. You must describe your method in the written report.&lt;br&gt;Part 2: Dealing with Node Failures&lt;br&gt;In this part you must implement additional functionality in your code to deal with random node&lt;br&gt;failures. Recall that in the base assignment specification it is assumed that once all nodes are up&lt;br&gt;and running they will continue to be operational till the end when all nodes are terminated&lt;br&gt;simultaneously. In this part you must ensure that your algorithm is robust to node failures. Once a&lt;br&gt;node fails, its neighbours must quickly be able to detect this and the corresponding links to this&lt;br&gt;failed node must be removed. Further, the routing protocol should converge and the failed nodes&lt;br&gt;should be excluded from the least-cost path computations. The other nodes should no longer&lt;br&gt;compute least-cost paths to the failed nodes. Furthermore, the failed nodes should not be included&lt;br&gt;in the least-cost paths to other nodes.&lt;br&gt;A simple method that is often used to detect node failures is the use of periodic heartbeat (also&lt;br&gt;often known as keep alive) messages. A heartbeat message is a short control message, which is&lt;br&gt;periodically sent by a node to its directly connected neighbours. If a node does not receive a&lt;br&gt;certain number of consecutive hearbeat messages from one of its neighbours it can assume that&lt;br&gt;this node has failed. Note that, each node transmits a link-state packet to its immediate neighbour&lt;br&gt;every UPDATE_INTERVAL (1 second). Hence, this distance vector message could also double&lt;br&gt;up as the hearbeat message. Alternately, you may wish to make use of an explicit heartbeat&lt;br&gt;message (over UDP), which is transmitted more frequently (i.e. with a period less than 1 second)&lt;br&gt;to expedite the detection of a failed node. It is recommended that you wait till at least 3 consequent&lt;br&gt;hearbeat (or link-state) messages are not received from a neighbour before considering it to have&lt;br&gt;failed. This will ensure that if at all a UDP packet is lost then it does not hamper the operation of&lt;br&gt;your protocol.&lt;br&gt;Once a node has detected that one of its neighbours has failed, it should update its link-state packet&lt;br&gt;accordingly to reflect the change in the local topology. Eventually, via the propagation of the&lt;br&gt;updated link-state packets, other nodes in the network will become aware that the failed node is&lt;br&gt;unreachable and it will be excluded from the link-state computations (i.e. Dijkstra’s algorithm).&lt;br&gt;Once a node has failed, you may assume that it cannot be initialised again.&lt;br&gt;While marking, we will only fail a few nodes, so that a reasonable connected topology is still&lt;br&gt;maintained. Furthermore, care will be taken to ensure that the network does not get partitioned. In&lt;br&gt;a typical topology (recall that the largest topology used for testing will consist of 10 nodes), at&lt;br&gt;most 3 nodes will fail. However, note that the nodes do not have to fail simultaneously.&lt;br&gt;Recall  that  each  node  will  execute  Dijkstra’s  algorithm  periodically  after&lt;br&gt;ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL (30 seconds) to compute the least-cost path to every other&lt;br&gt;destination. It may so happen that the updated link-state packets following a node failure may not&lt;br&gt;have reached certain nodes in the network before this interval expires. As a result, these nodes will&lt;br&gt;use the old topology information (prior to node failure) to compute the least-cost paths. Thus the&lt;br&gt;output at these nodes will be incorrect. This is not an error. It is just an artefact of the delay&lt;br&gt;incurred in propagating the updated link-state information. To account for this, it is necessary to&lt;br&gt;wait for at least two consecutive ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL periods (i.e. 1 minute) after the&lt;br&gt;node failure is initiated. This will ensure that all the nodes are aware of the topology change.&lt;br&gt;While marking, we will wait for 2&lt;em&gt;ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL following a node failure&lt;br&gt;before checking the output.&lt;br&gt;3.2. An Example&lt;br&gt;Let us look at an example with the network topology as shown in the figure below:&lt;br&gt;The numbers alongside the links indicate the link costs. The configuration files for the 6 nodes are&lt;br&gt;available for download from the assignment webpage. In the configuration files we have assumed&lt;br&gt;the following port assignments: A at 2000, B at 2001, C at 2002, D at 2003, E at 2004 and F at&lt;br&gt;2005. However note that some of these ports may be in use by another student logged on to the&lt;br&gt;same CSE machine as you. In this case, change the port assignments in all the configuration files&lt;br&gt;appropriately. The program output at node A should look like the following:&lt;br&gt;least-cost path to node B: AB and the cost is 2.0&lt;br&gt;least-cost path to node C: ADEC and the cost is 3.0&lt;br&gt;least-cost path to node D: AD and the cost is 1.0&lt;br&gt;least-cost path to node E: ADE and the cost is 2.0&lt;br&gt;least-cost path to node F: ADEF and the cost is 4.0&lt;br&gt;Note: It is not necessary that your program should print the paths to the destinations in&lt;br&gt;alphabetical order.&lt;br&gt;You may also test out the ability of your program to deal with node failures in the above example&lt;br&gt;by causing node B to fail (as an example).&lt;br&gt;Please ensure that before you submit, your program provides a similar output for the above&lt;br&gt;topology. However, we will use different network topologies in our testing.&lt;br&gt;4. Additional Notes&lt;br&gt;This is not a group assignment. You are expected to work on this individually.&lt;br&gt;How to start: Sample UDP client and server programs are available on the Week 3 lecture&lt;br&gt;material page. They are a good starting point to start your development. You will also find several&lt;br&gt;links to network programming resources on that page.&lt;br&gt;A&lt;br&gt;D&lt;br&gt;B  C&lt;br&gt;E&lt;br&gt;F&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;5&lt;br&gt;1&lt;br&gt;1&lt;br&gt;1&lt;br&gt;3&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;5&lt;br&gt;3&lt;br&gt;Language and Platform: You are free to use one of C, JAVA or Python to implement this&lt;br&gt;assignment. Please choose a language that you are comfortable with. The programs will be tested&lt;br&gt;on CSE Linux machines. So please make sure that your entire application runs correctly on these&lt;br&gt;machines. This is especially important if you plan to develop and test the programs on your&lt;br&gt;personal computers (which may possibly use a different OS or version or JVM). Note that CSE&lt;br&gt;machines support the following: gcc version 4.9.2, Java 1.7, Python 2.7, 2.8 and 3. Note for&lt;br&gt;Python: In your report, please indicate which version of Python you have used. You may only use&lt;br&gt;the basic socket programming APIs providing in your programming language of choice. Note that,&lt;br&gt;the network will be simulated by running multiple instances of your program on the same machine&lt;br&gt;with a different port number for each node. Make sure that your program will work appropriately&lt;br&gt;under these conditions. See the sequence of operations listed below for details.&lt;br&gt;Error Condition: Note that all the arguments supplied to the programs will be in the appropriate&lt;br&gt;format. The configuration files supplied as an argument to each node will also be consistent with&lt;br&gt;the test topology. Your programs do not have to handle errors in format, etc.&lt;br&gt;You should be aware that port ID’s, when bound to sockets, are system-wide values and thus other&lt;br&gt;students may be using the port number you are trying to use. On Linux systems, you can run the&lt;br&gt;command netstat to see which port numbers are currently assigned.&lt;br&gt;Do not worry about the reliability of UDP in your assignment. It is possible for packets to be&lt;br&gt;dropped, for example, but the chances of problems occurring in a local area network are fairly&lt;br&gt;small. If it does happen on the rare occasion, that is fine. Further, your routing protocol is&lt;br&gt;inherently robust against occasional losses since the link state packets are exchanged every 1&lt;br&gt;second. If your program appears to be losing or corrupting packets on a regular basis, then there is&lt;br&gt;likely a fault in your program.&lt;br&gt;Test your assignment out with several different topologies (besides the sample topology provided).&lt;br&gt;Make sure that your program is robust to node failures by creating several failed nodes (however&lt;br&gt;make sure that the topology is still connected). You can very easily work out the least-cost paths&lt;br&gt;manually (as shown in the lecture notes or the textbook) to verify the output of your program.&lt;br&gt;5. File Naming Convention and Assignment Submission&lt;br&gt;Your main program should be named Lsr.c (or Lsr.java or Lsr.py). You may of course have&lt;br&gt;additional header files and/or helper files. If you are using C you MUST submit a makefile/script&lt;br&gt;(not necessary with Java and Python). In addition you should submit a small report, report.pdf&lt;br&gt;(no more than 3 pages) describing the program design and a brief description of how your system&lt;br&gt;works. Describe the data structure used to represent the network topology and the link-state packet&lt;br&gt;format. Comment on how your program deals with node failures and restricts excessive link-state&lt;br&gt;broadcasts. Also discuss any design tradeoffs considered and made. Describe possible&lt;br&gt;improvements and extensions to your program and indicate how you could realise them. If your&lt;br&gt;program does not work under any particular circumstances please report this here. Also indicate&lt;br&gt;any segments of code that you have borrowed from the Web or other books.&lt;br&gt;You do not have to submit any topology files.&lt;br&gt;Here are the step-by-step instructions for submission:&lt;br&gt;1. Log in to your CSE account.&lt;br&gt;2. Create a directory called assign and copy ONLY the necessary files into that directory.&lt;br&gt;3. Tar this directory using the following command: “tar –cvf assign.tar assign”&lt;br&gt;4. Submit your assignment using the following command: “give cs3331 assign2 assign.tar”. You&lt;br&gt;should receive a confirmation of your submission.&lt;br&gt;Alternately, you may submit the tar archive via the submission link at the top of the assignment&lt;br&gt;web page.&lt;br&gt;Note that, the system will only accept assign.tar as the file name. All other names will be rejected.&lt;br&gt;You can submit as many times as you like before the deadline. A later submission will override&lt;br&gt;the previous submission, so make sure you submit the correct version. Do not wait till just before&lt;br&gt;the deadline for submission, as there may be unforeseen problems (brief disconnection of Internet&lt;br&gt;connectivity, power outage, computer crash, etc.).&lt;br&gt;Late Submission Penalty: Late penalty will be applied as follows:&lt;br&gt;• 1 day after deadline: 10% reduction&lt;br&gt;• 2 days after deadline: 20% reduction&lt;br&gt;• 3 days after deadline: 30% reduction&lt;br&gt;• 4 days after deadline: 40% reduction&lt;br&gt;• 5 or more days late: NOT accepted&lt;br&gt;NOTE: The above penalty is applied to your final total. For example, if you submit your&lt;br&gt;assignment 2 days late and your score on the assignment is 10, then your final mark will be 10 – 2&lt;br&gt;(20% penalty) = 8.&lt;br&gt;6. Plagiarism&lt;br&gt;You are to write all of the code for this assignment yourself. All source codes are subject to strict&lt;br&gt;checks for plagiarism, via highly sophisticated plagiarism detection software. These checks may&lt;br&gt;include comparison with available code from Internet sites and assignments from previous&lt;br&gt;semesters. In addition, each submission will be checked against all other submissions of the&lt;br&gt;current semester. Do not post this assignment on forums where you can pay programmers to write&lt;br&gt;code for you. We will be monitoring such forums. Please note that we take this matter quite&lt;br&gt;seriously. The LIC will decide on appropriate penalty for detected cases of plagiarism. The most&lt;br&gt;likely penalty would be to reduce the assignment mark to ZERO.&lt;br&gt;That said, we are aware that a lot of learning takes place in student conversations, and don’t wish&lt;br&gt;to discourage you from taking your classmates, provided you follow the Gilligan’s Island Rule -&lt;br&gt;After a joint discussion of an assignment or problem, each student should discard all written&lt;br&gt;material and then go do something mind-numbing for half an hour. For example, go watch an&lt;br&gt;episode of Gilligan’s Island (or Reality TV in modern terms), and then recreate the solutions. The&lt;br&gt;idea of this policy is to ensure that you fully understand the solutions or ideas that the group came&lt;br&gt;up with.&lt;br&gt;It is important, for both those helping others and those being helped, not to provide/accept any&lt;br&gt;programming language code in writing, as this is apt to be used exactly as is, and lead to&lt;br&gt;plagiarism penalties for both the supplier and the copier of the codes. Write something on a piece&lt;br&gt;of paper, by all means, but tear it up/take it away when the discussion is over. It is OK to borrow&lt;br&gt;bits and pieces of code from sample socket code out on the Web and in books. You MUST&lt;br&gt;however acknowledge the source of any borrowed code. This means providing a reference to a&lt;br&gt;book or a URL when the code appears (as comments). Also indicate in your report the portions of&lt;br&gt;your code that were borrowed. Explain any modifications you have made (if any) to the borrowed&lt;br&gt;code.&lt;br&gt;7. Forum Use&lt;br&gt;Students are strongly recommended to discuss about the assignment on the course forum.&lt;br&gt;However, at no point should any code fragments be posted to the message forum. Such actions&lt;br&gt;will be considered to be instances of plagiarism, thus incurring a significant penalty. Students are&lt;br&gt;also encouraged to share example topologies that they have created to test their program.&lt;br&gt;8. Sequence of Operation for Testing&lt;br&gt;The following shows the sequence of events that will be involved in the testing of your&lt;br&gt;assignment. Please ensure that before you submit your code you thoroughly check that your code&lt;br&gt;can execute these operations successfully.&lt;br&gt;1) First chose an arbitrary network topology (similar to the test topology above). Create the&lt;br&gt;appropriate configuration files that need to be input to the nodes. Note again that the&lt;br&gt;configuration files should only contain information about the neighbours and not of the entire&lt;br&gt;topology. Work out the least-cost paths and corresponding costs from each node to all other&lt;br&gt;destinations manually using Dijkstra’s algorithm as described in the lecture notes (or&lt;br&gt;textbook). This will allow you to check that your program is computing the paths correctly.&lt;br&gt;2) Log on to a CSE Linux machine. Open as many terminal windows as the number of nodes in&lt;br&gt;your test topology. Almost simultaneously, execute the routing protocol for each node (one&lt;br&gt;node in each terminal).&lt;br&gt;java lsr A 2000 configA.txt (for JAVA)&lt;br&gt;java lsr B 2001 configB.txt&lt;br&gt;and so on. You may write a simple script to automate this process.&lt;br&gt;3) Wait till the nodes display the output at their respective terminals.&lt;br&gt;4) Compare the displayed paths and costs to the ones obtained in step 1 above. These should be&lt;br&gt;consistent.&lt;br&gt;5) The next step involves testing the capability of your program to deal with failed nodes. For this&lt;br&gt;choose a few nodes (max of 3 nodes) from the topology that is currently being tested (in the&lt;br&gt;above tests) and terminate the nodes by typing CTRL-C in their respective terminal windows.&lt;br&gt;Make sure that the nodes chosen for termination do not partition the network. Work out the&lt;br&gt;least-cost paths from each node to all other destinations manually using Dijkstra’s algorithm as&lt;br&gt;described  in  the  lecture  notes  (or  textbook).  Wait  for  a  duration  of&lt;br&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL and observe the updated output at each node. Corroborate&lt;br&gt;the results with the manual computations.&lt;br&gt;6) Terminate all nodes.&lt;br&gt;NOTE: We will ensure that your programs are tested multiple times to account for any possible&lt;br&gt;UDP segment losses (it is quite unlikely that your routing packets will be dropped).&lt;br&gt;9. Marking Policy:&lt;br&gt;We will test your routing protocol for at least 2 different network topologies (which will be&lt;br&gt;distinct from the example provided). Marks will be deducted if necessary, depending on the extent&lt;br&gt;of the errors observed in the output at each node. After the marking process we will upload the test&lt;br&gt;topologies on the website for all students to view.&lt;br&gt;Your code will be marked using the following criteria:&lt;br&gt;• Mechanism to restrict link-state broadcasts: 1 marks&lt;br&gt;• Correct operation of the link state protocol: 5.5 marks&lt;br&gt;• Appropriate handling of dead nodes, whereby the least-cost paths are updated to reflect the&lt;br&gt;change in topology: 2.5 marks&lt;br&gt;• Report: 1 mark&lt;br&gt;Bonus Mark: You may receive 1 bonus mark for submitting the assignment a week before the&lt;br&gt;deadline, i.e. by 21 st October 2016 (Week 12). However, to receive the bonus mark, in addition&lt;br&gt;to submitting by the early deadline, your code should have scored at least 7 marks (out of 10) as&lt;br&gt;per the above criteria. The bonus mark can be used to offset lost marks in any assessable&lt;br&gt;component in this course (e.g. mid-semester exam, final exam, labs, etc.).&lt;br&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: For assignments that fail to execute all of the above tests, we will be&lt;br&gt;unable to award you a substantial mark. Note that, we will test your code multiple times before&lt;br&gt;concluding that there is a problem. You should test your program rigorously and verify the results&lt;br&gt;by trying out different topologies before submitting your code.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;本题是实现一个五子棋的游戏，给了部分模板代码，完成五子棋的游戏逻辑，主要考察c++的基础知识和OOP的设计能力，还有数据结构和算法&lt;br&gt;共分了4个task，难度逐渐递增，然后需要通过自动测试&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CompSys202/MechEng270&lt;br&gt;Data Structures and Algorithms&lt;br&gt;Assignment #3 (20% of final grade)&lt;br&gt;Due: 11:00am, 21 October 2016&lt;br&gt;Learning outcomes&lt;br&gt;The purpose of this assignment is to target the following learning outcomes:&lt;br&gt;• Demonstrate a basic understanding of C++ development.&lt;br&gt;• Continue to develop and practice your skills in OOP design.&lt;br&gt;• Practice using data structures and algorithms effectively.&lt;br&gt;• Apply good coding practices such as naming conventions and code style.&lt;br&gt;1 Connect Four!&lt;br&gt;The game of Connect Four is described by Wikipedia as follows:&lt;br&gt;[Connect Four] is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns&lt;br&gt;dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall&lt;br&gt;straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect&lt;br&gt;four of one’s own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your&lt;br&gt;opponent.&lt;br&gt;In this assignment you will construct a simple game of Connect Four. This game will be played between two human&lt;br&gt;players, and will be played until one player wins or a stalemate is reached. A simple demonstration of the Connect&lt;br&gt;Four game is displayed in figure 1.&lt;br&gt;2 Tasks&lt;br&gt;2.1 Player Information [Task 1] (15%)&lt;br&gt;2.1.1 Implement the Player Class&lt;br&gt;The Player class will store information about each player such as their name and color. A player has three&lt;br&gt;properties:&lt;br&gt;• The player’s name, e.g. “Nick”.&lt;br&gt;• The player’s score.&lt;br&gt;• The total number of games won by the player.&lt;br&gt;The player’s name can only be set in the constructor, while the score should be initialized to 0 and can only be&lt;br&gt;increased by 1 or reset using the methods of the Player class. The total number of games won by a player is&lt;br&gt;initialized to zero when the Player is constructed, and then can only be increased by 1.&lt;br&gt;Complete the implementation of the Player class as described in the file Player.hpp by adding code to Player.cpp.&lt;br&gt;1&lt;br&gt;(a) The game is created&lt;br&gt;with a standard 6 row by&lt;br&gt;7 column grid. At the be-&lt;br&gt;ginning of the game the&lt;br&gt;game grid is empty. The&lt;br&gt;top row of the grid is row&lt;br&gt;0 and the left-most col-&lt;br&gt;umn is column 0.&lt;br&gt;(b) The game starts with&lt;br&gt;player one’s turn. In this&lt;br&gt;case player one has in-&lt;br&gt;serted a disc (red) into&lt;br&gt;column 3. The disc falls&lt;br&gt;to the bottom of the grid&lt;br&gt;and stops at row 5.&lt;br&gt;(c) Player two plays their&lt;br&gt;first turn by inserting a&lt;br&gt;yellow disc into column&lt;br&gt;2. The disc falls to the&lt;br&gt;bottom of the grid to&lt;br&gt;come to rest next to the&lt;br&gt;disc placed by player one.&lt;br&gt;(d) Player one plays their&lt;br&gt;next move, placing a red&lt;br&gt;disc in column 4.&lt;br&gt;(e) Player two plays their&lt;br&gt;next move, inserting a&lt;br&gt;yellow disc in column 3.&lt;br&gt;This disc falls towards&lt;br&gt;the bottom of the grid&lt;br&gt;and stops at row 4, where&lt;br&gt;it is stacked on top of the&lt;br&gt;first disc placed by player&lt;br&gt;one.&lt;br&gt;(f) Player one plays their&lt;br&gt;next move, inserting a&lt;br&gt;second red disc into col-&lt;br&gt;umn 4. This disc falls to-&lt;br&gt;wards the bottom of the&lt;br&gt;grid, stacking on top of&lt;br&gt;a previously placed red&lt;br&gt;disc.&lt;br&gt;(g) Player two plays their&lt;br&gt;third move, inserting a&lt;br&gt;yellow disc into column&lt;br&gt;3, where it comes to rest&lt;br&gt;in row 3 on top of two&lt;br&gt;other discs already in-&lt;br&gt;serted into that column.&lt;br&gt;(h) Player one plays their&lt;br&gt;fourth move, inserting a&lt;br&gt;red disc in column 5 that&lt;br&gt;falls to the bottom of the&lt;br&gt;grid (row 5).&lt;br&gt;(i) Player two plays their&lt;br&gt;fourth move by inserting&lt;br&gt;a yellow disc into column&lt;br&gt;4 which stops at row 3&lt;br&gt;due to other discs previ-&lt;br&gt;ously inserted into that&lt;br&gt;column.&lt;br&gt;(j) Player one plays their&lt;br&gt;fifth move, inserting a&lt;br&gt;disc into column 6. This&lt;br&gt;disc falls to the bottom&lt;br&gt;row (row 5) and com-&lt;br&gt;pletes a horizontal row of&lt;br&gt;four red discs. Connect&lt;br&gt;four! Player one wins!&lt;br&gt;Figure 1: A demonstration of the Connect Four game in action.&lt;br&gt;2.1.2 Testing the Player Class&lt;br&gt;Testing code in this assignment works in a similar way to Assignments 1 and 2. When you are ready to test your&lt;br&gt;code, you can compile and run the tests by executing the command make test from the command-line console.&lt;br&gt;The tests for the Player class are already enabled in test.cpp.&lt;br&gt;If you need further information on how to test your code, refer to the testing sections of the assignment briefs&lt;br&gt;for assignments 1 and 2.&lt;br&gt;2.2 Tracking Player Moves [Task 2] (20%)&lt;br&gt;2.2.1 Implement the Grid Class&lt;br&gt;The Grid class is represents the vertically suspended grid into which players insert their colored discs. Each cell&lt;br&gt;of the grid can be represented by a value from the Cell enum declared inside the Grid class. Each cell will either&lt;br&gt;be empty, or hold a disc inserted by one of the two players. The number of cells is determined by the number of&lt;br&gt;rows and columns in the grid, and your Grid class constructor should allow the creation of a game Grid with any&lt;br&gt;size greater than 4 rows by 4 columns. In the case where one of the initialized dimensions is smaller than 4, that&lt;br&gt;dimension should be modified to be exactly 4. For example, if a grid is initialized with 2 rows and 6 columns, it&lt;br&gt;should be automatically corrected to 4 rows and 6 columns inside the Grid constructor.&lt;br&gt;During a game, discs may be inserted into the Grid by either player using the insertDisc method, which takes&lt;br&gt;a Cell value representing the new disc and a column of the grid that the disc should be inserted into. When a disc&lt;br&gt;is inserted into the grid it should be inserted on top of the other discs in the grid, or at the bottom of the grid if&lt;br&gt;there are no other discs in that column. This emulates the physical effect of inserting the disc into the grid in a&lt;br&gt;physical game of Connect Four.&lt;br&gt;To implement the game, other classes will need to be able to access elements in the grid. This information will&lt;br&gt;be accessed using the public cellAt method, which returns a value from the Grid given a specific row and column.&lt;br&gt;This method should return GC_EMPTY for any row or column outside the bounds of the grid. The bounds of the grid&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;will be returned by the rowCount and columnCount methods.&lt;br&gt;Once the game is over, the game grid needs to be emptied of all inserted player discs so a new game can be&lt;br&gt;started. In the Grid class this is done using the reset method.&lt;br&gt;Complete the implementation for the Grid class in Grid.cpp based on the declarations already created for you&lt;br&gt;in Grid.hpp. Make sure to read the comments above the class and each method in the class for more information&lt;br&gt;on how to implement them properly.&lt;br&gt;2.2.2 Testing the Grid Class&lt;br&gt;The tests for the Grid class can be enabled by uncommenting the following line at the top of test.cpp:&lt;br&gt;// #define ENABLE_T2_TESTS&lt;br&gt;Once the Task 2 tests are enabled, run make test to execute all of the currently enabled tests. Remember that&lt;br&gt;not all aspects of the Grid class may be tested in the tests you have been given, so don’t assume the task is&lt;br&gt;complete once all of the tests pass.&lt;br&gt;2.3 Creating a Connect Four Game [Task 3] (30%)&lt;br&gt;2.3.1 Implement the Game Class&lt;br&gt;The Game class composes the Grid class, aggregates multiple instances of the Player class together and performs&lt;br&gt;the game logic. A game is created using the default constructor for the Game class. The Game’s status method will&lt;br&gt;return GS_INVALID until two Players are assigned to the Game using the setPlayerOne and setPlayerTwo methods&lt;br&gt;and a Grid is assigned using the setGrid method.&lt;br&gt;The game will be executed one turn at a time using the playNextTurn method, with the nextPlayer method&lt;br&gt;providing (read-only) information about which player’s turn it is next. Once the game is complete, the status&lt;br&gt;method will return GS_COMPLETE, and return the winning player via the winner method. Note that if the game is a&lt;br&gt;draw, the winner method will return a null pointer (0), but the Game’s status will still be GS_COMPLETE. If a new&lt;br&gt;game is requested, the state of the current game can be cleared using the restart method.&lt;br&gt;You will need to create code to calculate the status of the game by traversing the grid and identifying 4 or more&lt;br&gt;discs from the same player in a row in any vertical, horizontal or diagonal orientation. Once one player gets at&lt;br&gt;least 4 discs in a row in any direction, they win the game. When a player wins the game, the Game state should&lt;br&gt;be updated accordingly so that the game status is set to GS_COMPLETE and the corresponding Player is returned&lt;br&gt;via the winner method. When a Player wins a game, their score and total number of wins should be increased by&lt;br&gt;1 using the appropriate methods of the Player class (a tie does not count as a win for either player). When the&lt;br&gt;game is restarted (using the restart method), each Player’s score should be reset. The possible directions discs&lt;br&gt;can be connected in to win the game are shown in figure 2 below.&lt;br&gt;(a) A vertical connect-four&lt;br&gt;for the red player (player&lt;br&gt;one).&lt;br&gt;(b) A horizontal connect-&lt;br&gt;four for the red player&lt;br&gt;(player one).&lt;br&gt;(c) A diagonal-up connect-&lt;br&gt;four for the red player&lt;br&gt;(player one).&lt;br&gt;(d) A diagonal-down&lt;br&gt;connect-four for the yellow&lt;br&gt;player (player two).&lt;br&gt;Figure 2: Completed games showing a winning combination in each possible direction. The winning combination&lt;br&gt;of discs has been highlighted in each example.&lt;br&gt;Complete the implementation for the Game class in Game.cpp based on the declarations already created for you&lt;br&gt;in Game.hpp. Make sure to read the comments above the class and each method in the class for more information&lt;br&gt;on how to implement them properly.&lt;br&gt;2.3.2 Testing the Game Class&lt;br&gt;The tests for the Game class can be enabled by uncommenting the following line at the top of test.cpp:&lt;br&gt;3&lt;br&gt;// #define ENABLE_T3_TESTS&lt;br&gt;Once the Task 3 tests are enabled, run make test to execute all of the currently enabled tests. Remember that&lt;br&gt;not all aspects of the Game class may be tested in the tests you have been given, so don’t assume the task is&lt;br&gt;complete once all of the tests pass.&lt;br&gt;2.4 Super Connect Four [Task 4] (15%)&lt;br&gt;In this task you will implement a variant of the classic Connect Four game we will call “Super Connect Four”. In&lt;br&gt;this variant of the game when a player connects four or more discs in a row, those discs will be removed from the&lt;br&gt;grid. This will cause any discs above the removed discs to move down to fill the space in the grid left by the removal&lt;br&gt;of the connected discs. One point will be added to the score of the player who connected the discs. If another line&lt;br&gt;of four or more discs belonging to one player exists after all affected discs have been moved, then this process is&lt;br&gt;repeated. This process continues until the grid reaches a stable state where no more lines of four discs exist and no&lt;br&gt;more cells need to be moved. One turn of such a game is demonstrated in figure 3.&lt;br&gt;(a) The initial game&lt;br&gt;board state for this&lt;br&gt;example. Both&lt;br&gt;players have already&lt;br&gt;made several moves.&lt;br&gt;(b) Player two plays&lt;br&gt;the next move, form-&lt;br&gt;ing a chain of four&lt;br&gt;discs horizontally in&lt;br&gt;row 3. Player two’s&lt;br&gt;score is increased by&lt;br&gt;1.&lt;br&gt;(c) The connected&lt;br&gt;discs are removed&lt;br&gt;from the game grid,&lt;br&gt;leaving blank spaces&lt;br&gt;in the grid.&lt;br&gt;(d) The remaining&lt;br&gt;discs above the ones&lt;br&gt;that were removed&lt;br&gt;are moved down&lt;br&gt;vertically to fill&lt;br&gt;the empty space in&lt;br&gt;the grid. Moving&lt;br&gt;the discs forms two&lt;br&gt;new chains of discs&lt;br&gt;belonging to player&lt;br&gt;one.&lt;br&gt;(e) The grid is&lt;br&gt;scanned, and two&lt;br&gt;new chains belong-&lt;br&gt;ing to player one are&lt;br&gt;found. Player one’s&lt;br&gt;score is increased by&lt;br&gt;1 and the discs are&lt;br&gt;removed from the&lt;br&gt;grid.&lt;br&gt;(f) The disc that was&lt;br&gt;above the removed&lt;br&gt;discs is moved to&lt;br&gt;the bottom of the&lt;br&gt;grid. The grid is re-&lt;br&gt;scanned but no new&lt;br&gt;chains of discs have&lt;br&gt;been formed and no&lt;br&gt;discs need to be&lt;br&gt;moved down. Player&lt;br&gt;two’s turn ends.&lt;br&gt;Figure 3: A demonstration of one turn in the “Super Connect Four” game.&lt;br&gt;The process for each turn of the game should be as follows:&lt;br&gt;1. Make the player’s move by inserting their token into the grid.&lt;br&gt;2. Check to see if any chains of 4 or more discs in any direction have been formed.&lt;br&gt;3. Increase the score by 1 for any players whose discs have formed chains of 4 or more. Each player’s score may&lt;br&gt;only increase by 1 each time the grid is checked (even if players get multiple simultaneous chains in a single&lt;br&gt;check).&lt;br&gt;4. Remove all discs in all chains from the grid.&lt;br&gt;5. Fill all spaces in the grid created in the previous step by moving the discs above the spaces down.&lt;br&gt;6. Repeat from step 2 until no more chains of discs are found and the grid has reached a stable state.&lt;br&gt;Make sure that disc the disc removal and movement steps are fully completed before the grid is re-scanned. Failing&lt;br&gt;to do so may cause additional matches while the grid is still between stable states. This is important for scenarios&lt;br&gt;such as those shown in figure 4 and figure 5.&lt;br&gt;Just as in normal Connect Four, players take alternating turns until the game is complete. This game will end&lt;br&gt;once there is no more space in the grid for either player to insert discs. The winner is the player with the highest&lt;br&gt;score at the end of the game.&lt;br&gt;4&lt;br&gt;(a) The initial game&lt;br&gt;board state for this ex-&lt;br&gt;ample. Both players&lt;br&gt;have already made sev-&lt;br&gt;eral moves.&lt;br&gt;(b) Player one plays the&lt;br&gt;next move, forming a&lt;br&gt;chain of four discs hori-&lt;br&gt;zontally in row 2 as well&lt;br&gt;as a diagonal chain of&lt;br&gt;four discs. Player one’s&lt;br&gt;score is increased by 1.&lt;br&gt;(c) The connected discs&lt;br&gt;are removed from the&lt;br&gt;game grid, leaving blank&lt;br&gt;spaces in the grid.&lt;br&gt;(d) The remaining discs&lt;br&gt;above the ones that&lt;br&gt;were removed are moved&lt;br&gt;down vertically to fill the&lt;br&gt;empty space in the grid.&lt;br&gt;The grid is stable, so&lt;br&gt;this is the end of player&lt;br&gt;one’s turn.&lt;br&gt;Figure 4: A demonstration of a turn in the “Super Connect Four” game where multiple chains of discs are formed&lt;br&gt;for a player in the same move.&lt;br&gt;(a) The initial game&lt;br&gt;board state for this ex-&lt;br&gt;ample. Both players&lt;br&gt;have already made sev-&lt;br&gt;eral moves.&lt;br&gt;(b) Player one plays the&lt;br&gt;next move, forming a&lt;br&gt;chain of four discs hori-&lt;br&gt;zontally in row 5. Player&lt;br&gt;one’s score is increased&lt;br&gt;by 1.&lt;br&gt;(c) The connected discs&lt;br&gt;are removed from the&lt;br&gt;game grid, leaving blank&lt;br&gt;spaces in the grid.&lt;br&gt;(d) The remaining discs&lt;br&gt;above the ones that&lt;br&gt;were removed are moved&lt;br&gt;down vertically to fill the&lt;br&gt;empty space in the grid.&lt;br&gt;Moving the discs forms&lt;br&gt;new chains of discs for&lt;br&gt;both players.&lt;br&gt;(e) The grid is scanned,&lt;br&gt;and new chains belong-&lt;br&gt;ing to both players are&lt;br&gt;found. Both player’s&lt;br&gt;scores are increased by&lt;br&gt;1 and the discs are re-&lt;br&gt;moved from the grid.&lt;br&gt;There are no more discs&lt;br&gt;to move down. Player&lt;br&gt;one’s turn ends.&lt;br&gt;Figure 5: A more complex example of the behavior of the “Super Connect Four” game.&lt;br&gt;2.4.1 Implement the SuperGame class&lt;br&gt;Implement the SuperGame class in SuperGame.hpp and SuperGame.cpp by deriving from the Game class, therefore&lt;br&gt;reducing the amount of code you need to write by inheriting some of the functionality of the Game class. The&lt;br&gt;SuperGame class should use the interface defined by the Game class so that it can be substituted in place of the Game&lt;br&gt;class to provide a new game experience with the same user interfaces.&lt;br&gt;The scoring for the SuperGame is different to the original Game class. When a player gets a chain of four discs&lt;br&gt;their score still increases by 1. However, the game does not end until the game grid has been filled, so the “winner”&lt;br&gt;of the game is determined by the Player with the highest score once the game grid has been filled and no more&lt;br&gt;moves can be played. Once the game is over the winner has their win counter increased by 1. Both player’s scores&lt;br&gt;are still reset when the game is restarted.&lt;br&gt;2.4.2 Testing the SuperGame class&lt;br&gt;The tests for the SuperGame class can be enabled by uncommenting the following line at the top of test.cpp:&lt;br&gt;// #define ENABLE_T4_TESTS&lt;br&gt;Once the Task 4 tests are enabled, run make test to execute all of the currently enabled tests. Remember that&lt;br&gt;not all aspects of the SuperGame class may be tested in the tests you have been given, so don’t assume the task&lt;br&gt;is complete once all of the tests pass.&lt;br&gt;You have also been given a command-line interface (main.cpp) which can be used for advanced testing of your&lt;br&gt;5&lt;br&gt;code by playing a Connect Four or Super Connect Four game. To build and run the command-line interface, use&lt;br&gt;the command make run from the command-line console.&lt;br&gt;You may share any tests you write for this assignment with classmates on Piazza.&lt;br&gt;2.5 Code Inspection (20%)&lt;br&gt;Your code will be inspected for:&lt;br&gt;• Effective use of OOP&lt;br&gt;• Consistent coding style&lt;br&gt;• Code commenting&lt;br&gt;• Memory management&lt;br&gt;Marks will be allocated for each by your marker.&lt;br&gt;Important: how your code will be marked&lt;br&gt;• Your code will be marked using a semi-automated setup. If you fail to follow the setup given, your code will&lt;br&gt;not be marked. All submitted files must compile without requiring any editing. Use the provided tests and&lt;br&gt;Makefile to ensure your code compiles and runs without errors on the university Ubuntu lab PCs. Any tests&lt;br&gt;that run for longer than 10 seconds will be terminated and will be recorded as failed.&lt;br&gt;• Although you may add more to them (e.g. member variables, #include statements, or helper functions), you&lt;br&gt;must not modify the existing interface of classes defined in the following files (e.g. do not delete or modify&lt;br&gt;the existing functions declared):&lt;br&gt;– ConnectFour/Player.hpp&lt;br&gt;– ConnectFour/Grid.hpp&lt;br&gt;– ConnectFour/Game.hpp&lt;br&gt;• Do not move any existing code from the ConnectFour directory, and make sure all of your new code files are&lt;br&gt;created inside the ConnectFour directory.&lt;br&gt;• You may modify test.cpp as you please (for your own testing purposes); this file will not be marked at all.&lt;br&gt;Be aware that your code must still work with the original test.cpp. Do not change the location of this file.&lt;br&gt;You are free to share any additional tests you create with classmates on Piazza.&lt;br&gt;• Your code will also be inspected for good programming practices, particularly using good object-oriented&lt;br&gt;principles. Think about naming conventions for variables and functions you declare. Make sure you comment&lt;br&gt;your code where necessary to help the marker understand why you wrote a piece of code a specific way, or&lt;br&gt;what the code is supposed to do. Use consistent indentation and brace placement.&lt;br&gt;Submission&lt;br&gt;You will submit via Canvas. Make sure you can get your code compiled and running with test.cpp (make test) on&lt;br&gt;the university Ubuntu computers. Submit the following, in a single ZIP archive file:&lt;br&gt;• A signed and dated declaration stating that you worked on the assignment independently, and that it is&lt;br&gt;your own work. Include your name, ID number, the date, the course and assignment number. You can find&lt;br&gt;this Cover Sheet on Canvas. All code will be checked against other submissions. Submissions detected as&lt;br&gt;being similar to others will ensure that the students involved are forwarded to the Misconduct Committee.&lt;br&gt;• The entire contents of the src_for_students folder you were given at the start of the assignment, including&lt;br&gt;the new code you have written for this assignment. Ensure you execute make clean before zipping the&lt;br&gt;folder so your submission doesn’t include any executable files (your code will be re-built for marking).&lt;br&gt;6&lt;br&gt;Academic honesty&lt;br&gt;• The work done on this assignment must be your own work. Think carefully about any problems you come&lt;br&gt;across, and try to solve them yourself before you ask anyone for help. Under no circumstances should you&lt;br&gt;take or pay for an electronic copy of someone else’s work.&lt;br&gt;• All submitted code will be checked using software similarity tools. Submissions with suspicious similarity will&lt;br&gt;result in an Investigative Meeting and will be forwarded to the Disciplinary Committee.&lt;br&gt;• Penalties for copying will be severe – to avoid being caught copying, don’t do it.&lt;br&gt;• To ensure you are not identified as cheating you should follow these points:&lt;br&gt;– Always do individual assignments by yourself.&lt;br&gt;– Never show or give another person your code.&lt;br&gt;– Never put your code in a public place (e.g. Reddit, Github, forums, your website).&lt;br&gt;– Never leave your computer unattended. You are responsible for the security of your account.&lt;br&gt;– Ensure you always remove your USB flash drive from the computer before you log off.&lt;br&gt;Late submissions&lt;br&gt;Late submissions incur the following penalties:&lt;br&gt;• 15% penalty for zero to 24 hours late&lt;br&gt;• 30% penalty for 25 to 48 hours late&lt;br&gt;• 100% penalty for over 48 hours late&lt;br&gt;You must double check that you have uploaded the correct code for marking! There will be no exceptions&lt;br&gt;if you accidentally submitted the wrong files, regardless of whether you can prove you did not modify them since&lt;br&gt;the deadline. No exceptions.&lt;br&gt;7&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;总共有2个part，第一个part是完成client类的机构methods方法，然后在main函数测试，主要考察java基础能力和单元测试&lt;br&gt;part2是完成3个类。重复使用client类，然后新家一个 Book class和BookStore class。类似一个book管理系统，比part1稍微工作&lt;br&gt;量多一些，也输入java入门知识&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CS1073  Assignment 3  Due: 8:30am October 4, 2016 in the Lab or any&lt;br&gt;time prior to 8:15am in the assignment bin.&lt;br&gt;Part 1. Write a program to implement a class called Client that contains the values: name,discount and cumulative&lt;br&gt;purchase amount. Supply an appropriate constructor and methods as described below:&lt;br&gt;•  getName: returns the clients name&lt;br&gt;•  addPurchase: accepts the current purchase amount as a parameter and adds it to the cumulative purchase&lt;br&gt;amount&lt;br&gt;•  getPurchase: returns the cumulative purchase amount&lt;br&gt;•  setDiscount: sets the client’s discount to a specified percentage&lt;br&gt;•  getDiscount: returns the client’s discount&lt;br&gt;•  resetClient: resets the discount percentage and the cumulative purchase amount of the client to zero&lt;br&gt;•  The constructor: accepts one parameter (name) and sets the discount and cumulative amount to zero.&lt;br&gt;Write a main method in a driver class called TestClient to test the Client class. It should have the following functionality:&lt;br&gt;•  Prompt the user for the name of the client and create the client (set the client’s discount and cumulative&lt;br&gt;purchase amount to zero).&lt;br&gt;•  Prompt the user for a discount percentage for the client and update the client’s discount. Read the discount&lt;br&gt;percentage as an integer.&lt;br&gt;•  The client makes a purchase. Prompt the user for the total amount of the current purchase before her/his&lt;br&gt;discount. Apply the client’s discount to the purchase amount. Remember that the client’s discount has been&lt;br&gt;stored as an integer, so to use it as a percentage you need to divide it by 100.00.&lt;br&gt;•  Print the total amount to be paid by the client after her/his discount.&lt;br&gt;•  Update the cumulative purchase amount of the client by adding the purchase amount after applying the&lt;br&gt;discount.&lt;br&gt;•  The client gets a new discount for being a good client. Prompt the user for the new discount, and update it in&lt;br&gt;the client’s information.&lt;br&gt;•  The client makes another purchase. Prompt the user for the total amount of the current purchase before&lt;br&gt;discount. Apply the client’s discount and print the total to be paid after the discount.&lt;br&gt;•  Update the client’s cumulative purchase amount by adding the total payment after discount,&lt;br&gt;•  Print the client’s information (name, discount, cumulative purchase).&lt;br&gt;•  The store is starting a new selling season, the Christmas season. For this season reset the percentage discount&lt;br&gt;and cumulative purchase amount to zero. Print the client’s information (name, discount, cumulative purchase).&lt;br&gt;•  Test your program for a client named Monique Levesque. She initially gets a 5% discount. In her first purchase,&lt;br&gt;she spends $245.99 before any discount. Her new discount for being a good client is 25%. She makes another&lt;br&gt;purchase of $60.00 before any discount.&lt;br&gt;Print all amounts rounded to two decimal places.&lt;br&gt;Part 2 In this part of the assignment you are going to use three classes. You are going to reuse the Client class that you&lt;br&gt;implemented above, and implement two new classes: a Book class and a BookStore class. The BookStore class is the&lt;br&gt;driver class for the Client and Book classes.&lt;br&gt;For the implementation of the Book class use the following guidelines. A book has a title, a price, and a discount. There&lt;br&gt;are four methods (getTitle. getPrice. setPrice. getDiscount) as well as two constructors as described below:&lt;br&gt;•  getTitle: returns the title of the book.&lt;br&gt;•  getPrice: returns the current price of the book.&lt;br&gt;•  setPrice: changes the price to a specified amount.&lt;br&gt;•  getDiscount: returns the current discount for the book.&lt;br&gt;First constructor: accepts two parameters (title and price) and sets the title and price while setting the discount&lt;br&gt;percentage to 0% (i.e. this book has no discount).&lt;br&gt;Second constructor: accepts three parameters (title. price and the discount percentage) and sets them all accordingly.&lt;br&gt;Write the BookStore class that uses the Client and Book classes. The main method of the BookStore class should have&lt;br&gt;the following functionality:&lt;br&gt;•  Prompt the user for the first book (Title: HTML for the World Wide Web, Price: 24.95, Percentage Discount: 5%)&lt;br&gt;and create the corresponding book object.&lt;br&gt;•  Read the discount percentage as an integer.&lt;br&gt;•  Prompt the user for the second book (Title: Operating Systems. Price: 69.95). Do not prompt for the percentage&lt;br&gt;discount; let the class initialize it for you. Create the corresponding book object.&lt;br&gt;•  Change the price of the HTML book to $30.00.&lt;br&gt;•  Now create a client: Andrea Smith.&lt;br&gt;•  Set Andrea’s percentage discount to 15%.&lt;br&gt;•  Andrea buys the two books mentioned above. Print an invoice for Andrea. Obtain the cost of each book after&lt;br&gt;applying the individual book discount. Then. apply the client’s discount to the total cost of the books. Remember&lt;br&gt;that the discount values are integers and you have to divide them by 100.00 when you need to use them as a&lt;br&gt;percentage. The format of the invoice should be as follows&lt;br&gt;Andrea Smith&lt;br&gt;$ 28.50 HTML for the World Wide Web&lt;br&gt;$ 69.95 Operating Systems&lt;br&gt;————–&lt;br&gt;$ 98.45 subtotal&lt;br&gt;$ 14.77 Client’s Discount&lt;br&gt;————&lt;br&gt;$ 83.68 Total&lt;br&gt;•  Update Andrea’s client information with the cumulative purchase amount.&lt;br&gt;•  Print Andrea’s information (name, discount, cumulative purchase).&lt;br&gt;•  Print all amounts rounded to two decimal places.&lt;br&gt;Summary:&lt;br&gt;You will have 2 class files: Client &amp;amp; Book&lt;br&gt;You will have 2 driver files: TestClient &amp;amp; Bookstore&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;c语言实现还一个Nim的游戏，需要使用很多数据结构，trees, linked-lists, and stack等等完成人机对战版本&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/4&lt;br&gt;KIT107 Programming  2016&lt;br&gt;Assignment 3&lt;br&gt;Due Date&lt;br&gt;The assignment is due at 3PM Wednesday October 12 th 2016 and should be completed in pairs.&lt;br&gt;Context&lt;br&gt;Nim is a game played between two players. 21 objects (matches, coins, or lollies) are placed in&lt;br&gt;front of the players and, having decided who will go first, each player removes one, two, or three&lt;br&gt;objects in alternating turns. The goal is to force the other player to remove the final object — the&lt;br&gt;player to remove the final object is the loser!&lt;br&gt;This assignment uses many data structures (trees, linked-lists, and stacks) to implement a human-&lt;br&gt;versus-computer version of the game. The game will be text only. The computer will choose its&lt;br&gt;move by creating a game tree. A game tree consists of all the possible states of the game and the&lt;br&gt;computer determines the outcome of particular choices to guide which choice is the best. The state&lt;br&gt;of the game is defined as comprising how many objects remain in the game and how good (or bad)&lt;br&gt;the outcome looks (an int from -9 to +9). Each node of the game tree has children that indicate&lt;br&gt;the states of the game that follow from the state of the parent for each possible move, i.e. there are&lt;br&gt;likely to be three children for each node, one with one additional object removed, one with two, and&lt;br&gt;one with three.&lt;br&gt;2/4&lt;br&gt;A sample run of the game is shown below.&lt;br&gt;The project contains many files. All required files are present. Your task is simply to complete the&lt;br&gt;functions within the program files which have been declared but for which the function bodies are&lt;br&gt;missing.&lt;br&gt;Program Style&lt;br&gt;Your program should follow the following coding conventions:&lt;br&gt;  const variable identifiers should be used as much as possible, should be written all in&lt;br&gt;upper case and should be declared before all other variables;&lt;br&gt;  Variable identifiers should start with a lower case letter;&lt;br&gt;  Every if and if-else statement should have a block of code (i.e. collections of lines&lt;br&gt;surrounded by { and }) for both the if part and the else part (if used);&lt;br&gt;  Every loop should have a block of code;&lt;br&gt;  The keyword continue should not be used;&lt;br&gt;  The keyword break should only be used as part of a switch statement;&lt;br&gt;  Opening and closing braces of a block should be aligned;&lt;br&gt;  All code within a block should be aligned and indented 1 tab stop (or 4 spaces) from the&lt;br&gt;braces marking this block;&lt;br&gt;  Commenting:&lt;br&gt;o  There should be a block of header comment which includes at least&lt;br&gt;  file name&lt;br&gt;  student names&lt;br&gt;  student identity numbers&lt;br&gt;  a statement of the purpose of the program&lt;br&gt;  date&lt;br&gt;o  Each variable declaration should be commented&lt;br&gt;o  There should be a comment identifying groups of statements that do various parts of&lt;br&gt;the task&lt;br&gt;3/4&lt;br&gt;o  Comments should describe the strategy of the code and should not simply translate&lt;br&gt;the C into English&lt;br&gt;What and how to submit&lt;br&gt;What to submit&lt;br&gt;Paper submission&lt;br&gt;  A signed cover page (blanks can be collected from the ICT Reception/Help Desk or from&lt;br&gt;the ICT web site at&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/161375/GroupAssignmentCover.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;http://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/161375/GroupAssignmentCover.pdf&lt;/a&gt;);&lt;br&gt;  A landscape-orientation print-out of the three ‘.c’ source code files for the program. Your&lt;br&gt;assignment will not be marked unless these are present; and&lt;br&gt;  A statement from each person indicating what proportion of the work was theirs. If the&lt;br&gt;work was done equally, then each person should claim 50% of the effort. It is expected that&lt;br&gt;this will be the case and this will be assumed if no statement is submitted. If, however, one&lt;br&gt;person has done very little, then this should be stated. A reason why this is the case should&lt;br&gt;be given. For example, if one student does 80% of the work because their partner did not&lt;br&gt;turn up to meetings, complete work by the agreed time, etc. then this should be stated. If&lt;br&gt;one student does 30% of the work because the other student simply went off and did it all by&lt;br&gt;themselves and without consultation then this should be stated.&lt;br&gt;Electronic submission&lt;br&gt;  You should submit the entire Visual Studio project folder.&lt;br&gt;How to submit&lt;br&gt;Paper submission&lt;br&gt;  Firmly staple together all of the required documents (with the signed cover page on top) and&lt;br&gt;place them in the appropriate submissions box near the ICT Discipline Help Desk.&lt;br&gt;Electronic submission&lt;br&gt;  Go to your home directory on alacritas (M:). You will find there a directory (folder) called&lt;br&gt;kit107submit (If you do not have this folder, please contact the ICT Discipline Help&lt;br&gt;desk.)&lt;br&gt;  Copy your entire Visual Studio project folder (Assig3) into this directory. Open the folder&lt;br&gt;to see that the files have been copied.&lt;br&gt;  If you want to resubmit, open the kit107submit folder, remove the old version and copy&lt;br&gt;in the new version.&lt;br&gt;4/4&lt;br&gt;Marking scheme&lt;br&gt;Task/Topic  Maximum&lt;br&gt;mark&lt;br&gt;Program operates as specified&lt;br&gt;node.c correctly completed  6&lt;br&gt;stack.c correctly completed  6&lt;br&gt;gameState.c correctly completed  7&lt;br&gt;tNode.c correctly completed  14&lt;br&gt;gameTree.c correctly completed  31&lt;br&gt;Program Style&lt;br&gt;Does not unnecessarily repeat tests or have other redundant/confusing code  8&lt;br&gt;Uses correctly the C naming conventions  8&lt;br&gt;Alignment of code and use of white space makes code readable  8&lt;br&gt;Always uses blocks in branch and loop constructs  8&lt;br&gt;Meaningful identifiers  8&lt;br&gt;Variables declared at the top of functions  8&lt;br&gt;Each variable declaration is commented  8&lt;br&gt;Comments within the code indicate the purpose of sections of code (but DO NOT just duplicate&lt;br&gt;what the code says)&lt;br&gt;8&lt;br&gt;Plagiarism and Cheating:&lt;br&gt;Practical assignments are used by the School of Engineering and ICT for students to both reinforce&lt;br&gt;and demonstrate their understanding of material which has been presented in class. They have a&lt;br&gt;role both for assessment and for learning. It is a requirement that work you hand in for assessment&lt;br&gt;is substantially your own.&lt;br&gt;Working with others&lt;br&gt;One effective way to grasp principles and concepts is to discuss the issues with your peers and/or&lt;br&gt;friends. You are encouraged to do this. We also encourage you to discuss aspects of practical&lt;br&gt;assignments with others. However, once you have clarified the principles, your pair must express&lt;br&gt;them in writing or electronically entirely by yourselves. In other words you must develop the&lt;br&gt;algorithm to solve the problem and write the program which implements this algorithm with your&lt;br&gt;partner and no one else (other than staff).&lt;br&gt;Cheating&lt;br&gt;  Cheating occurs if you claim work as your own when it is substantially the work of someone&lt;br&gt;else.&lt;br&gt;  Cheating is an offence under the Ordinance of Student Discipline within the University.&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, the ICT profession has ethical standards in which cheating has no place.&lt;br&gt;  Cheating involves two or more parties.&lt;br&gt;o  If you allow written work, computer listings, or electronic version of your code to be&lt;br&gt;borrowed or copied by another student you are an equal partner in the act of&lt;br&gt;cheating.&lt;br&gt;o  You should be careful to ensure that your work is not left in a situation where it may&lt;br&gt;be stolen by others.&lt;br&gt;  Where there is a reasonable cause to believe that a case of cheating has occurred, this will&lt;br&gt;be brought to the attention of the unit lecturer. If the lecturer considers that there is evidence&lt;br&gt;of cheating, then no marks will be given to any of the students involved. The case will be&lt;br&gt;referred to the Head of School for consideration of further action.&lt;br&gt;Julian Dermoudy, September 21 st 2016.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;用UDP和TCP套接字，完成一个简单的“黑客”游戏，有客户端和服务端，服务端生成密码，客户端猜测并且发送给&lt;br&gt;服务端验证，需要运用到了网络知识和c++知识&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CSE422 Computer Networks Fall 2016&lt;br&gt;Laboratory 1: Introduction to Socket Programming&lt;br&gt;Due: 23:59 Monday, Oct 3&lt;br&gt;1 Goal&lt;br&gt;Gain experience with socket programming by implementing a simple “hacker” game using&lt;br&gt;both UDP and TCP sockets. In this game, one participant tries to guess a four-digit password&lt;br&gt;known to the other participant, receiving feedback on each guess as described below.&lt;br&gt;2 Overview&lt;br&gt;In this lab, you will implement a networking version of the hacking mini game, which will&lt;br&gt;comprise of two C++ programs, one client and one server. This lab will help you to gain&lt;br&gt;experience with socket programming using Berkeley socket interface. In order to focus more&lt;br&gt;on the details of socket programming part, the game and most of the command parsing are&lt;br&gt;provided as a skeleton code.&lt;br&gt;This lab is worth for 60 points. This lab is due no later than 23:59 Monday, Oct 3. No late&lt;br&gt;submission will be accepted.&lt;br&gt;3 Specification&lt;br&gt;In this lab, you are required to implement a client and a server program for the ”hacker”&lt;br&gt;game. The server program and client program will interact by exchanging messages to&lt;br&gt;simulate the game play. A simple message/packet format is provided in the file: message.h.&lt;br&gt;The server and client program will handshake through TCP and the gaming interaction will&lt;br&gt;use UDP.&lt;br&gt;3.1 “Hacker” Game&lt;br&gt;The game will display a list of possible passwords (formatted in a way to mimic what is seen&lt;br&gt;in the Fallout game series). The user will then enter a guess for which one they believe the&lt;br&gt;password to be. The game will report back the “likeness” of the guess (how many correct&lt;br&gt;letters are in the correct position).&lt;br&gt;1&lt;br&gt;For example, suppose the password is ”FULL” and the displayed text, containing all of the&lt;br&gt;possible passwords, is:&lt;br&gt;ROBCO INDUSTRIES (TM) TERMALINK PROTOCOL&lt;br&gt;ENTER PASSWORD NOW&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The default number of attempts is set to 4.&lt;br&gt;A demo of the ”hacking” game play can be found at: [Demo Play]&lt;br&gt;-In the demo, click the power button in the right lower corner then click on the phase that&lt;br&gt;you would like to guess as the password.&lt;br&gt;3.2 The Server Program&lt;br&gt;Example invocation: ./server&lt;br&gt;The server program will create a TCP socket and will then wait for an incoming TCP&lt;br&gt;connection. This TCP socket’s port will be assigned by the operating system and will be&lt;br&gt;printed to the console. We assume that the client knows this TCP port number, because the&lt;br&gt;client is started after the server. When the server receives an incoming TCP connection, it&lt;br&gt;creates a UDP socket, whose port is also assigned by the OS. Via the TCP socket, the server&lt;br&gt;program returns a packet to the client containing the UDP port number. This can be done&lt;br&gt;using the UDP Cntr MSG type found in message.h.&lt;br&gt;Once the UDP connection is established, the server program initializes a variable of type&lt;br&gt;HackerGame. The initialization of this variable generates the server password, a list of&lt;br&gt;possible passwords, a string to act as the display board for the game, and the number&lt;br&gt;of attempts left. These are accessible through functions in the HackerGame class. We&lt;br&gt;recommend that you look over HackerGame.h. Guesses from the client can be evaluated by&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;using the TestEntry() function. The server keeps receiving and testing guesses from the&lt;br&gt;client until either the number of attempts has been exhausted or the password is guessed&lt;br&gt;correctly. For each guess, the server sends a packet containing the “Likeness” of the guess&lt;br&gt;to the client using the UDP socket. Once the game is over, either by guessing the password&lt;br&gt;correctly or running out of attempts, the server must notify the client using the UDP socket,&lt;br&gt;after which the server closes both the TCP and UDP sockets.&lt;br&gt;3.3 The Client Program&lt;br&gt;Example invocation: ./client -h lenny.cse.msu.edu -p 48192&lt;br&gt;The client program is required to accept the following arguments.&lt;br&gt;• -h is the server address (domain name).&lt;br&gt;• -p is the TCP port number on which the server listens for an incoming connection.&lt;br&gt;The client resolves the server address by using gethostbyname() and connects to the server&lt;br&gt;over TCP. The client then receives a packet from the server containing the UDP port number.&lt;br&gt;Using the UDP port number, the client sends a confirmation message to the server, letting&lt;br&gt;it know that it can send the first game message, using the UDP socket. The client receives a&lt;br&gt;packet containing the game display text and prints it to console. The client then takes input&lt;br&gt;from the user for the a guess at the password and sends the guess to the server program via&lt;br&gt;the UDP socket. For each guess the client should receive a response containing the likeness&lt;br&gt;of the guess and how many attempts are left. These are to be printed to console.&lt;br&gt;The client should monitor the content of each game message for ending conditions. Specif-&lt;br&gt;ically, if AttemptsLeft = 0 or IsGameWon = true, then the client should print to console&lt;br&gt;either “Terminal Locked Out!” or”Access Granted!”, respectively. The client then closes&lt;br&gt;both the TCP and UDP sockets.&lt;br&gt;3.4 Packet Format: message.h&lt;br&gt;There are two different types of packets for this lab; both are defined in message.h.&lt;br&gt;1. UDP Cntr MSG: which contains only one field: int port&lt;br&gt;2. Game MSG: which contains:&lt;br&gt;(a) char Display[1000]&lt;br&gt;(b) int AttemptsLeft&lt;br&gt;(c) bool IsGameWon&lt;br&gt;(d) int Likeness&lt;br&gt;3&lt;br&gt;(e) char Entry[10]&lt;br&gt;String type variables cannot be used in these packets due to how they utilize memory. For&lt;br&gt;information to be correctly sent in packets, the packet most know the starting address of the&lt;br&gt;variable and how large it is. Hence why we use arrays of chars.&lt;br&gt;You may want to still use strings in your client and server programs, however. Following are&lt;br&gt;two examples of copying content between the two variable types.&lt;br&gt;Copying char array to a string:&lt;br&gt;char Word1[10] = “test”;&lt;br&gt;string Word2(Word1); //Word2 now contains “test”&lt;br&gt;Copying a string to a char array:&lt;br&gt;string Word2 = “test”;&lt;br&gt;char Word1[10];&lt;br&gt;strcpy(Word1, Word2.c str()); // Word1 now contains “test”&lt;br&gt;4 Deliverables&lt;br&gt;You will submit your lab using the web based handin utility. Don’t use the command-line&lt;br&gt;based handin facility. Please submit all files in your project directory. If you start your lab&lt;br&gt;with the skeleton code, submit all files, even if the file is not modified.&lt;br&gt;This lab is due no later than 23:59 Monday, Oct 3. No late submission will be accepted.&lt;br&gt;The compilation must be done using a makefile. The code should compile on multiple&lt;br&gt;machines (can use lenny, carl, bart, etc). Please do not do your debugging on the servers&lt;br&gt;(arctic or black). You will not be awarded any points if your submission does not compile&lt;br&gt;using a makefile. A sample makefile will be provided. It will only have to be changed if you&lt;br&gt;add more files to your solution. Please test your programs before handing them in.&lt;br&gt;A README file is required including your name, PID, and machines that you tested on.&lt;br&gt;You will run your server and client programs and paste the output in your README file.&lt;br&gt;A sample README file is also included in the skeleton code. You are also encouraged to&lt;br&gt;include explanations about parts of your code that may not work in the README file.&lt;br&gt;5 Example&lt;br&gt;Follows is an example of output from the client and server. Your output may differ.&lt;br&gt;1. Invoke the server&lt;br&gt;4&lt;br&gt;Server:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;./server&lt;br&gt;Creating TCP Socket…&lt;br&gt;TCP socket has port number: 53401&lt;br&gt;2. Invoke the client. The client connects to the server using the TCP connection infor-&lt;br&gt;mation that you provide via the command line.&lt;br&gt;Client:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;./client -h lenny.cse.msu.edu -p 53401&lt;br&gt;Client is running…&lt;br&gt;remote host: lenny.cse.msu.edu, remote TCP port: 53401&lt;br&gt;Connected to Server!&lt;br&gt;3. Server accepts the TCP connection from the client and sends the UDP port information&lt;br&gt;using the TCP connection.&lt;br&gt;Server:&lt;br&gt;A new client is connected to the server!&lt;br&gt;Creating UDP Socket…&lt;br&gt;UDP socket has port number: 32471&lt;br&gt;Sending UDP port number to client using TCP connection…&lt;br&gt;4. Client uses the message from the TCP connection to establish an UDP port.&lt;br&gt;Client:&lt;br&gt;Reading TCP socket for UDP set up info…&lt;br&gt;UDP port on Server: 32471&lt;br&gt;Server IP: 35.9.23.42&lt;br&gt;Establishing UDP Connection…&lt;br&gt;5. Once the UDP connection is established, the server starts the game and accepts guesses&lt;br&gt;from the client until either the password is guessed or the number of attempts is&lt;br&gt;exhausted. Optionally the server can display the password for debugging purposes.&lt;br&gt;Server:&lt;br&gt;Password: FOUR&lt;br&gt;Starting game…&lt;br&gt;Entry: term&lt;br&gt;Likeness: 0&lt;br&gt;Entry: ball&lt;br&gt;Likeness: 0&lt;br&gt;Entry: year&lt;br&gt;Likeness: 1&lt;br&gt;Entry: four&lt;br&gt;Likeness: 4&lt;br&gt;Access Granted!&lt;br&gt;Closing TCP and UDP sockets…&lt;br&gt;5&lt;br&gt;Client:&lt;br&gt;Receiving first game message…&lt;br&gt;ROBCO INDUSTRIES (TM) TERMALINK PROTOCOL&lt;br&gt;Entry: term&lt;br&gt;Likeness: 0&lt;br&gt;Attempts left: 3&lt;br&gt;Entry: ball&lt;br&gt;Likeness: 0&lt;br&gt;Attempts left: 2&lt;br&gt;Entry: year&lt;br&gt;Likeness: 1&lt;br&gt;Attempts left: 1&lt;br&gt;Entry: four&lt;br&gt;Access Granted!&lt;br&gt;Closing TCP and UDP sockets…&lt;br&gt;6 Grading&lt;br&gt;You will not be awarded any points if your submission does not compile.&lt;br&gt;Please feel free to mail TA Glen Simon simongle AT msu.edu for questions or clarifications.&lt;br&gt;Additional notes and FAQ willl be posted on the website as well.&lt;br&gt;7&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>
