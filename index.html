Put you name and student ID as a comment on each file.<br>2. Save your files into a single folder and create a zip file of this folder called yourFirstName yourLastName.zip<br>3. Submit your zip file containing your solution to Moodle. Make sure that your assignment is not in “Draft”<br>mode. You need to click “Submit” to successfully submit the assignment.<br>4. Your assignment will not be accepted unless it is a readable zip file.<br>Important Notes:<br>1. Please ensure that you have read and understood the university’s policies on plagiarism and collusion<br>available at <a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/students/policies/academic-integrity.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.monash.edu.au/students/policies/academic-integrity.html</a>. You will be<br>required to agree to these policies when you submit your assignment. The assignments will be checked for<br>plagiarism using an advanced plagiarism detector.<br>2. You must not use the built-in functions to sort (e.g., sort() or sorted()), search (e.g., x in list) or<br>to find the maximum/minimum element in the list (e.g., max() or min()): please write your own Python<br>code for these if required. You are not allowed to import any Python library or module.<br>3. Your program will be checked against a number of test cases. Do not forget to include comments in your<br>code explaining your algorithm. If your implementations have bugs, you may still get some marks based<br>on how close your algorithm is to the correct algorithm.<br>4. For each task, you need to write a program that properly decomposes the problem. You will learn functions<br>and decomposition in Week 6.<br>Marks: This assignment has a total of 30 marks and contributes to 15% of your final mark. Late submission<br>will have 10% off the total assignment marks per day (including weekends) deducted from your assignment<br>mark, i.e., 3 marks per day. So, if you are 1 day late, you will lose 3 marks. Assignments submitted 7 days<br>after the due date will normally not be accepted.<br>Marking Guide:<br>Task 1: 8 marks<br>(a) Code readability (Non-trivial comments where necessary and meaningful variable names) – 1 mark<br>(b) Code decomposition – 1 mark<br>(c) Correctly determining the minimum and maximum score given by a judge to a participant – 2 marks<br>(d) Final scores correctly computed for each contestant – 2 marks<br>(e) Creating the “Scoreboard” table and displaying the final score for each participant – 2 marks<br>1<br>Task 2: 10 marks<br>(a) Code readability (Non-trivial comments where necessary and meaningful variable names) – 1 marks<br>(b) Code decomposition – 1 mark<br>(c) Correctly determining if a palindrome can be formed using all letters or not – 2 marks<br>(d) Correctly determining the lexicographically smallest palindrome – 6 marks<br>Task 3: 12 marks<br>(a) Code readability (Non-trivial comments where necessary and meaningful variable names) – 1 mark<br>(b) Proper decomposition of the problem – 1 mark<br>(c) Correctly writing isGood(s1,s2) function – 2 marks<br>(d) Correctly writing isAlmostGood(s1,s2) function – 6 marks<br>(e) Correctly determining if the string is a bad string using – 2 marks<br>Task 1: Australian Idol 8 Marks<br>You are hired by Australian Idol to write a program to create a scoreboard for them. Each participant is<br>judged by 5 different judges where each judge gives a score between 0 to 10. You are given an input file named<br>raw scores.txt which contains 10 lines (one for each participant). Each line contains 6 strings separated by<br>spaces. The first string in each line is the name of the participant. The remaining 5 strings record the scores<br>given by the 5 judges to the participant. Below is an example showing scores for three participants Mark, Alice<br>and Alan.<br>Mark 1 10 0 2 9<br>Alice 8 10 8 0 10<br>Alan 10 10 10 10 10<br>The final score of each participant is computed as follows. To handle potentially biased judges, the highest<br>score and lowest score received for the participant are ignored and the average of remaining three scores is<br>the final score. E.g., for Mark, the highest score 10 and the lowest score 0 are ignored and his final score is<br>1+2+9<br>3<br>= 4. Alice’s final score is<br>8+8+10<br>3<br>= 8.67 (ignoring lowest score 0 and one of the two 10 scores) and<br>Alan’s final score is<br>10+10+10<br>3<br>= 10 (ignoring the lowest score 10 and the highest score 10). Note that the final<br>score is rounded to two decimal points (e.g., Alice’s score is rounded to 8.67). You can use round() function<br><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round" target="_blank" rel="external">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round</a>.<br>Your program should read the raw scores.txt file and compute the final score for each participant. The<br>results must be stored in a table called “Scoreboard” that consists of two columns recording the names of the<br>participants and their final scores. Your program must also print the final score for each participant. Below is<br>a sample output for the above input.<br>Mark: 4<br>Alice: 8.67<br>Alan: 10<br>Important: Your program will be checked on an input file that will contain data different than the data<br>provided in raw scores.txt file. Therefore, do not tweak your program to work only for the provided file (e.g.,<br>by manually computing scores). However, you can assume that the input file will contain exactly 10 participants<br>and each participant will be judged by exactly 5 judges. You can also assume that the name of the input file<br>will be the same, i.e., raw scores.txt.<br>Task 2: Palindromes 10 Marks<br>You are given a sequence of letters (all lowercase). Your goal is to rearrange the letters to form a palindrome.<br>The palindrome must contain all the given letters. The palindrome does not need to be an English word, i.e.,<br>it is any sequence of letters that is the same when reversed. If there is more than one palindromes that can<br>be formed using all of the given letters, your program must output the lexicographically smallest palindrome<br>string (i.e., the palindrome that appears first in the alphabetical order <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><br>2<br>Alphabetical_order). For example, if the input sequence of letters is x y x z y, then xyzyx and yxzxy both<br>are palindrome strings formed using all the letters in the sequence. However, xyzyx is the lexicographically<br>smallest. Thus, the output must be xyzyx. If no palindrome can be formed by the letters in the input sequence<br>then you must output impossible. For example, if the input sequence is a l g o r i t h m, your program<br>must output impossible.<br>Your program must read from the input file named letters.txt that contains a single line containing a<br>sequence of letters separated by spaces. Below is a sample input file.<br>x y x z y<br>There may be up to 1000 letters in the input line. Your program must create a list containing all these<br>letters. Then, the program must print the lexicographically smallest palindrome that can be formed by the<br>letters in the list. If no palindrome can be formed using all these letters, your program must output impossible<br>Task 3: (Almost) Good Strings 12 Marks<br>Suppose you are given two strings named s1 and s2 (containing only lowercase letters). The string s1 is called<br>a “good” string if it contains s2, i.e., s2 is a substring of s1. For example, if s1 is smart and s2 is art, then<br>s1 is a good string because smart contains art. The string s1 is called “almost good” if it is not a “good”<br>string but inserting one character into it would make it a “good” string. For example, if s1 is smart and s2<br>is mark, then s1 is not a good string because mark is not a substring of smart. But s1 is an “almost good”<br>string because inserting the letter k in s1 (between r and t) makes it smarkt which is a “good” string because<br>it contains mark. The string s1 is called a “bad” string if it is neither a “good” nor an ”almost good” string.<br>You need to write two functions called isGood(s1, s2) and isAlmostGood(s1, s2) that return true if<br>and only if s1 is “good” and “almost good”, respectively.<br>Your program must ask the user to enter two input strings: first input string will be s1 and the second input<br>string will be s2. Both strings must be converted to lowercase letters. Then, the program must call the two<br>functions to determine whether s1 is a “good”, “almost good” or “bad” string. The result must be printed.<br>3<br><br><br><br></font>

The data will be read into separate objects depending on the type of pet. For<br>example, data about a dog will be stored in a dog object. All of the objects will be added to<br>one list and searching and sorting operations will be performed on that list. The steps:<br>• Define a Dog class with the attributes: name, birthdate (store as string), breed, color.<br>• Define a Cat class with the attributes: name, birthdate (store as string), breed, color.<br>• Define a Fish class with the attributes: name, birthdate (store as string), type, color.<br>• Define a Bird class with the attributes: name, birthdate (store as string), type, color.<br>• Each class must have <strong>init</strong>(), accessors/mutators, and <strong>str</strong>() methods.<br>• Write a python program petfinder.py that imports the four classes defined above.<br>• Read the pets.csv file into your program. Each line contains information about a single<br>pet with its individual attributes separated by commas. Here is a sample data file, in<br>CSV (comma separated values) format. You can create your own pets.csv file.<br>Fish, Nemo, April 2nd, GoldFish, Orange,<br>Cat, Shadow, July 3rd, American Bobtail, White,<br>Dog, Dug, August 1st, Golden Retriever, Brown,<br>Bird, Nigel, January 15th, Pelican, Brown,<br>• For every line in the data file, read in all fields for a single pet and create a new object<br>for that pet depending on its type (the first string in each line).<br>• Create a list containing the objects and add every new object to the list as it is created.<br>• When the list of pet objects has been created, its size should equal the number of pets in<br>the data file. Hint: Use this to check if your code is working so far, before continuing.<br>• Display the following menu to users:<br>1. Show pet names: displays only the names of all the pets<br>2. Show pets of a certain type: Asks users what kind of pet (dog/cat/fish/bird). Show<br>only pets that match the user input.<br>3. Search for pet. Call your own binary search function to search for the first pet<br>name that matches the user-entered string. If a pet is found in the list, then print all<br>the details for that pet and the index in the list where it was found. If the pet is not in<br>the list, then print a message informing the user that the pet is not in the list.<br>Prof Jeff Johnson   CS 110<br>4. Sort list based on pet name: After sorting the list, display the sorted list. (For this<br>and the next sort option you can use either selection sort or insertion sort.)<br>5. Sort list based on pet color: After sorting the list, display the sorted list.<br>6. Exit the program.<br>Make sure to include input validation wherever you get input from the user and include<br>lots of comments in your code so others can understand it.<br>Submitting the project<br>Using CyberDuck or your favorite file transfer program, create a directory for project4 in<br>your submit directory.

Using techniques similar to solving<br>Sudoku you will also implement a solver for the KenKen puzzle. Both imple-<br>mentations will use the Z3 solver to actually solve the problem and Python will<br>be used to interact with Z3.<br>2 Introduction to Z3<br>Z3 is an SMT solver which means it is able to determine whether a logical<br>statement is true or false (within certain limitations).<br>Here are some examples of using Z3 from within Python:<br>Proving DeMorgan’s Law:<br>1 from z3 import ∗<br>2 s = Solver () # Z3 solver instance<br>3 a = Bool ( ’a ’ ) # Z3 boolean variable a<br>4 b = Bool ( ’b ’ ) # Z3 boolean variable b<br>5 a or b = Or(a ,b) # a or b means a or b is true<br>6 nna and nb = Not(And(Not(a) , Not(b) ) )<br>7 # nna and nb means not ( not (a) and not (b) )<br>8 # is true<br>9 s . add( a or b != nna and nb ) # Here we are asserting to Z3<br>10 # (a or b) is not equivalent to<br>11 # ˜(˜a and ˜b)<br>12 s . check () # Here we ask Z3 i f our statement is<br>13 # s a t i s f i a b l e or unsatisfiable<br>When running this in python interactive mode, Z3 reports unsat which means<br>that our assertion that<br>(a ∨ b) 6= ¬(¬a ∧ ¬b)<br>is false. This means that it’s negation (DeMorgan’s Law) is true.<br>1<br>Finding Pythagorean triples, e.g., integers x,y,z such that x 2 + y 2 = z 2 :<br>1 from z3 import ∗<br>2 s = Solver () # Z3 solver instance<br>3 x = Int ( ’x ’ ) # Z3 Integer variable x<br>4 y = Int ( ’y ’ ) # Z3 Integer variable y<br>5 z = Int ( ’z ’ ) # Z3 Integer variable z<br>6 s . add(And(x &gt; 0 , y &gt; 0 , z &gt; 0) ) # Assert x , y and z are all<br>7 # positive<br>8 s . add(x∗x + y∗y == z∗z) # Assert xˆ2 + yˆ2 = zˆ2<br>9 s . check () # Query Z3 to see i f it can find an answer<br>10 s . model () # Get the satisfying assignment for x , y and z<br>11 s . add(x != 12) # Disallow the solution where x = 12<br>12 s . check () # Check i f Z3 can s t i l l find an answer<br>13 s . model () # Get the satisfying assignment<br>In this example, Int() creates an integer variable in Z3. 1 On line 6 a constraint<br>was added to the solver, e.g., we constrained the values of x,y and z to be<br>positive. On line 8 an additional constraint is added which states that we are<br>interested only in integers that solve the equation x 2 + y 2 = z 2 . On line 9 we<br>ask Z3 if the added constraints can be solved, which in this case is true. On<br>line 10 we ask Z3 for the assignment and get: x = 12, y = 9 and z = 15 (your<br>answer may vary). On line 11 we assert that x cannot be equal to 12 (this makes<br>Z3’s previous answer illegal). On lines 12 and 13 we check for satisfiability and<br>retrieve the solution which in this case is: x = 8, y = 6 and z = 10.<br>3 Introducing Python<br>A good tutorial to learn Python (this is the free version, you can’t watch videos<br>and might get pop ups):<br><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/</a><br>Read this to learn how to do list comprehensions in Python:<br><a href="http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list</a> comprehensions.hawk<br>More examples of using Python with Z3:<br><a href="http://cpl0.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://cpl0.net/</a> argp/papers/z3py-guide.pdf<br>Documentation of the Z3 Python API:<br><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/namespacez3py.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/namespacez3py.html</a><br>1 There is an important distinction between Int variables in Z3 and int variables in other<br>programming languages: In Z3, this declaration is akin to saying that, x for instance, x is<br>an element of the integers in a mathematical sense. In other programming languages, an int<br>simply allocates some amount of space which represents a value in a finite range of integers.<br>2<br>4 Useful Python and Z3 Commands<br>Solver() - Creates a solver for Z3.<br>s.add(constraint) - Adds a constraint to a Solver s.<br>s.check() - Returns sat if the current constraints are satisfiable, and unsat if<br>the constraints are unsatisfiable.<br>s.model() - Gets the satisfying instance from the solver. Note: this function<br>should only be called if s.check() returned sat.<br>Int(“name”) - Declares an integer variable in Z3.<br>The following functions can take either multiple arguments, e.g., Or(a, b, c)<br>or a list Or(my list).<br>And() - Asserts that all arguments given are true.<br>Or() - Asserts at least one argument given is true.<br>Distinct() - Asserts that all given variables are distinct.<br>Sum() - Creates a variable which is equal to the sum of the arguments.<br>Product() - Creates a variable equal to the product of the arguments.<br>Z3 also interacts with Python’s comparison and arithmetic operators:<br>1 from z3 import ∗<br>2 s = Solver ()<br>3 x = Int ( ’x ’ )<br>4 y = Int ( ’y ’ )<br>5 z = Int ( ’z ’ )<br>6 a = Int ( ’a ’ )<br>7 s . add(x != y) # Z3 variables x and y are asserted to be different<br>8 s . add(x == 3) # Z3 variable x is now equal to 3. This is different<br>9 # from assignment<br>10 s . add(z &gt;= y) # Z3 variable z is asserted to be greater than or<br>11 # equal to y<br>12 s . add(y &gt; 7) # y is asserted to be greater than 7<br>13 s . add(a == x + y) # a is now equal to x + y<br>14 s . add(x∗y &gt; 7)# The product of x and y is greater than 7<br>3<br>5 Sudoku Solver<br>The rules for Sudoku may be found here:<br>Sudoku - Wikipedia<br>For dimension 2, there will be 4 2x2 sub-grids, all squares will contain numbers<br>from 1 to 4 and the row/column/grid uniqueness rule remains.<br>For dimension 4, there will be 16 4x4 subgrids, all squares will contain numbers<br>from 1 to 16 and the row/column/grid uniqueness rule remains.<br>Part A: Modify sudoku base.py to accept puzzles which have dimensions other<br>than 3. You should not modify the input processing code and you should define<br>the limits in loops and constraints in terms of of the variable n. The variable n<br>is the length of the sub-grids in the puzzle. This is an easy exercise meant to<br>encourage you to study the implementation.<br>Part B: In the final if statement, after printing the solution add constraints<br>which assert that the solution is not valid. What this means is that there is a<br>solution where at least one of the blank squares in the puzzle can have a value<br>different from the same square in the solution. After adding this constraint,<br>you should check if there is a solution and print ”Solution is unique” if s.check()<br>does not return sat and print ”Solution is not unique” otherwise.<br>6 KenKen Solver<br>Please read KenKen - Wikipedia for an description of the KenKen puzzle.<br>It is recommended to start with your sudoku solution as a base because it will<br>able to accept different dimensions. Remove the section that adds the sub-grid<br>constraints. Also remove the code which detects non-unique solutions – this is<br>not required for this exercise.<br>The puzzle list contains lists representing the cages in the puzzle. puzzle[i][0]<br>holds the goal for the operation, puzzle[i][1] contains the operation to be used<br>for the cage. The operations will be ’+’, ’-’, ’<em>’, ’/’ and ’g’ which denote addi-<br>tion, subtraction, multiplication, division and given respectively. Here ”given”<br>means that the goal is the value of the indicated square. For cages using divi-<br>sion or subtraction, you may assume that the cage has two squares in it. Since<br>these operations are not commutative you will have to assert for squares a and<br>b a/b == goal or b/a == goal is true.<br>Finally, for a cage list cage cage[2</em>i] holds the row of the grid and cage[2*i+1]<br>holds the column of the grid where i is in the interval [1, len(cage)). These two<br>values indicate the coordinate of a square in the grid.<br>An example of a cage:<br>cage = [11, ’+’, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]<br>This means that the goal is 11, the operation is addition and the cage is on the<br>squares (0,0), (1,0) and (1,1).<br>4<br>Your solution should replace the code to enter the Sudoku puzzle in order<br>to encode these constraints into Z3.<br>7 Grading<br>For both parts you will not be graded on detecting invalid input (you should<br>not change the input or output code), nor the performance of your solution<br>(solutions which take more than 2 minutes on large tests will not be accepted).<br>It is recommended you test your solutions using the provided test files, e.g.,<br>sudoku testn.txt and kenken testn.txt. The reference results are in README.txt.<br>If you pass the provided tests, it is highly likely that you will receive full credit<br>on the assignment.<br>8 Set Up and Technical Issues<br>If you are using Windows:<br>Choose one of the MSI packages for Windows from<br><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-278/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-278/</a><br>Use 64-bit if you are able.<br>Follow the instructions to install Z3py (precompiled) at:<br><a href="http://z3.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Z3Py%20on%20Windows" target="_blank" rel="external">http://z3.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Z3Py%20on%20Windows</a><br>Make sure you set your path.

Everyone is responsible for their own<br>work. Under no circumstances should you turn in the work of someone else (including any code or<br>material you may find on the Internet) as your own, nor should you share your own work with others.<br>You may discuss general concepts with your classmates as long as these discussions do not lead to the<br>actual exchange of code fragments or written solutions.<br>You hav e several sources for help. Your first recourse should always be to post your question on the ICON<br>discussion board. This is the fastest place to go for clarifications or disambiguation, or for help with<br>Python in general (remember, don’t post your solution or any part of your solution). Second, if you must<br>share a portion of your code, you can always attend a TA help session (see the announcement on ICON<br>entitled General TA Office Hours start Thursday, September 1 for times and locations). You may also<br>attend my office hours Tuesdays from 1:30 to 3:30 in my office (14 MLH). Finally, you may email your<br>code with a specific question to me or to your TA, but please be sure that you include CS1210 on the<br>subject line (also, this is the slowest way of getting help, due to the volume of mail we are likely to<br>receive).<br>Introduction<br>For this two-part project you will be working with a medium-size dataset (about 800K records) of<br>education statistical indicators obtained from the World Bank. The dataset consists of two file:<br>f308b71c-00be-4519-9b0c-0d3100b75092_Data.csv<br>f308b71c-00be-4519-9b0c-0d3100b75092_Definition and Source.csv<br>both in csv or comma-separated value format. The first file contains the data, with each record having five<br>fields, described in the first line of this file as:<br>Co u n t ry,Co u n t ry Cod e , Se r i es Cod e , 2015 [YR 2015 ]<br>The next 762,000 lines contain records of this form, while the last five lines look like:<br>, , , ,<br>, , , ,<br>, , , ,<br>Da t a f rom da t aba s e : Edu ca t i on St a t i s t i cs - Al l Ind i ca t or s , , , ,<br>La s t Upd a t ed : 10 / 04 / 2016 , , , ,<br>and can safely be ignored (these lines are either blank — hence the rows of commas — or contain data<br>provenance information).<br>The second file contains information about the data contained in the first file. Each line is a record<br>consisting of four fields, described in the first line of this file as:<br>Co de , Ind i ca t or Name ,Lo n g defin i t i on , So ur ce<br>Each of these lines can be quite long, especially (and not surprisingly) the field called ‘‘Long definition.’’<br>Using the elipsis (‘‘…’’) to shorten the line, a sample field (the 10th line of the file to be precise) looks<br>like:<br>UI S .NERA. 3 , “Ad j us t ed . . . “ , “To t a l . . . “ ,UN ESCO Ins t i t u t e for St a t i s t i cs<br>1 Revised November 14, 2016<br>Aside from the textual descriptions, the most interesting field here is the first, which by design contains<br>interesting information about the type of data represented, and which is also appears as the third field in<br>the data file. The key idea is that records in the data file that share the same ‘‘Series Code’’ (or simply<br>‘‘Code’’ as its called in the definitions file file) are by definition directly comparable. So, for example, if I<br>am interested in the adjusted net enrollment rate for females in primary school (SE.PRM.TENR.FE)<br>across different countries or populations, I could compare all the records from the data file with this<br>‘‘Series Code’’ (there are 254 of these).<br>Reading Data<br>Your first task is to read these data into Python and construct an appropriate representation of these<br>records. You will write two functions to achieve this end.<br>First, write a function<br>de f r eadDe fin i t i ons (fil ename ) :<br>which opens file filename of the second type described above, that is:<br>Co de , Ind i ca t or Name ,Lo n g defin i t i on , So ur ce<br>and returns a dictionary D with entries of the form:<br>Co de : [ Ind i ca t or Name , Long defin i t i on , Sou r ce ]<br>Reading csv files can be tricky, because it is quite possible that some fields may contain explicit commas<br>embedded in a single field (see, e.g., the ‘‘Long definition’’ field). In such cases, these extraneous commas<br>are protected by enclosing the field in quotes. For example, consider the following line taken from a<br>hypothetical csv file representing Olympic gold medalists:<br>Fe n c i ng , “Ga roz zo , Dan i e l e” , ITA , 2016<br>Here, the correct interpretation is a single record (or line) containing four fields (and not five) because the<br>comma in the gold medalist’s name is not semantically equivalent to the other three commas in the line.<br>Fortunately, because this is such a common issue, Python provides a library for reading csv files while<br>honoring the semantics of commas embedded in quoted fields. To use the library, you must first:<br>impo r t csv<br>You will need to read up on how to use the csv library: more information can be found here:<br>h t t ps : / / do cs . py t hon . org / 3 . 5 / l i br a ry / csv . h tml<br>Important: do not attempt to split() the line, as I can guarantee this will fail. To be successful, you will<br>need to use the csv library. Also, be wary of the first line in the csv file, which is a ‘‘header’’ and should<br>not be included in the dictionary as data.<br>The second function you should write:<br>de f r eadDa t a (fi l ename ) :<br>should open a file filename of the first type above, that is:<br>Co u n t ry,Co u n t ry Cod e , Se r i es Cod e , 2015 [YR 2015 ]<br>and return a tuple of two dictionaries, C and V. The first dictionary, C, should have entries of the form:<br>Co u n t ry Cod e : Coun t ry<br>and therefore should look like, e.g.,<br>2 Revised November 14, 2016<br>{ ’US A’ : ’Un i t ed St a t es ’ , ’ ITA ’ : ’ I t a l y’ , ’PRT ’ : ’Po r t uga l ’ , . . . }<br>while the second dictionary, V, in the tuple should have entries of the form:<br>Se r i es Cod e : { Co u n t ry Cod e : 2015 [YR 2015 ] , . . . }<br>and thus look like, e.g.,<br>{ ’UI S .LR.AG15T9 9 .GPI ’ : { ’ARE ’ : ’1 . 02945005893707 ’ , . . . } , . . . }<br>Again, be wary of the fact that the first line in this csv file is also a ‘‘header’’ and should not be include in<br>the dictionary as data, but nor should the last five lines of this file, which represent summary information<br>and not real data.<br>In constructing the readData() function, it is important not to include entries where the corresponding<br>value is missing (missing values in this data file are indicated by a string, ’..’); there will be many fewer<br>values than the 762000 rows in the data file might imply. To get to the heart of the matter, you will write<br>a third function:<br>de f ma keP rofi l es (C, V) :<br>which will return a dictionary, P, indexed by country code with values consisting of the number of<br>datapoints present in V for that particular country. Thus part of P produced by your first implementation<br>of makeProfiles() might look like:<br>{ ’MA R’ : 307 , ’ IBT ’ : 0 , ’WS M’ : 293 , ’URY ’ : 269 , . . . }<br>Indicating that there is no data about ’IBT’ present in this dataset. You will note that ’IBT’ is defined in<br>C as ’IDA &amp; IBRD total’ rather than some country name; IDA and IBRD stand for International<br>Development Association and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, respectively, two<br>branches of the World Bank from which these data were obtained. Given that no data is provided, your<br>complete version of makeProfiles() should alter C to remove the entry for IBT and any other similar code<br>that has no data associated with it. Thus the value of P produced by your final version of makeProfiles()<br>might look like:<br>{ ’SMR’ : 14 , ’UMC ’ : 28 , ’ARG ’ : 263 , . . . }<br>should not contain any entries with 0 values, and should also modify C to remove those entries. If your<br>code is like mine, final versions of both P and C should contain 241 entries.<br>Finally, you will implement a plotting function:<br>de f p l o tPr ofil e (P) :<br>that will reproduce the figure shown here below.<br>Note how all of the country codes are arranged alphabetically along the x axis, with the y values<br>corresponding to the number of datapoints for that particular country code. You will need to study the<br>matplotlib pyplot documentation:<br>3 Revised November 14, 2016<br>h t t p : / /ma t p l o t l i b. org / ap i / pyp l o t _ap i . h tml<br>to learn how to make your code work.<br>Once this code is complete, we’ll turn our attention to a more interesting analysis of the data.<br>4 Revised November 14, 2016<br><br><br><br></font>

In this assignment, we apply most of these concepts to write a program that can combine and transform<br>tables of data in order to answer questions about that data. The program you will write is called SQuEaL. It<br>stands for Simplified Query Engine and Language, but more importantly it’s the noise that Dan Zingaro (at<br>UTM) made when he came up with what he thinks is a super-cool idea for this assignment. We’ll see!<br>Querying Data<br>The quantity and variety of data generated today requires that we have ways to organize that data and extract<br>pieces of data that are currently of interest. For example, you might have thousands of emails in your inbox<br>right now, but you have ways of searching and filtering that data to find messages from certain people, with<br>specific keywords, or sent on specific dates.<br>Nowhere is the importance of data more evident in our daily lives than when we interact with online retailers.<br>Consider the typical interaction with a website like Amazon. Perhaps you’re looking for a new CS book to<br>read over the holidays. You might search for Computer Science in the search box. Among the millions of<br>products available, Amazon returns only those products of relevance in the search results.<br>When you purchase a book, you are required to create a customer account. Amazon stores your account<br>information along with this order and all orders you make in the future. Later, you can check on your order<br>history to see exactly what you’ve purchased. Of course, millions of other customers have purchased stuff<br>too, so Amazon has to maintain all of this data and make sure that you see only your data and another person<br>sees only theirs. Amazon will also want to use this data for internal purposes to see how much they’ve sold,<br>what products are most popular, what kinds of ads to serve to you, etc. Data is used to answer a wide variety<br>of questions such as these:<br>What are the Computer Science books available right now?<br>Does the current user have a customer account?<br>What is the order history for the current customer?<br>How many products did Amazon sell this year?<br>What are the top ten most popular books this year?<br>Websites like Amazon use databases to store these vast amounts of data. They then make queries on that data<br>in order to retrieve data for a variety of purposes. One sample query might be: “give me all of the Computer<br>Science books”; another might be: “give me this customer’s order history, from oldest order to most recent<br>order”. There are languages used to make such queries on databases. The most popular of these languages is<br>SQL (Structured Query Language), and if you take CSCC43 you’ll learn a lot more SQL.<br>In this assignment, you’ll write a program that understands a SQL-like language for making queries of data.<br>Don’t worry: we won’t mention SQL again in this handout, and we expect no outside knowledge of databases<br>or SQL (OOPS!) or Amazon or anything like that. Everything is in this handout. Warning: if you know<br>some SQL, you should be extra careful to do what we are asking and not make assumptions based on<br>what you might have learned elsewhere.<br>Tables and Databases<br>11/21/2016<br>2/9<br>The first two important terms for us are table and database. From now on, when we use these terms, they<br>mean what is described in this section.<br>Below is a sample table that we will call  movies . It contains information on movies; try to understand what<br>the table is showing before continuing to the text below.<br>movies<br>m.year m.title m.studio m.gross<br>1997 Titanic Par. 2186.8<br>2003 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King NL 1119.9<br>2010 Toy Story 3 BV 1063.2<br>The table starts with a header giving the names of each column. The column names are  m.year ,  m.title<br>m.studio , and  m.gross . (Ignore the  m. prefix for now; you’ll see why it’s there soon.) Note that the header<br>isn’t one of the data rows. The data rows are the rows below the header. The table has four columns, and each<br>row gives a value in each column. For example, we see that the first movie is Titanic, the year it was made<br>was 1997, the studio that produced it was Par. (short for Paramount), and the gross revenue (amount the<br>movies made) for the movie was 2186.8. (Yes, that’s given in millions of dollars… anyone who hasn’t<br>dropped CS to enroll in film school, please continue reading.)<br>So that’s a table: a grid where each column has a column name and each row gives a value for each column.<br>Each row corresponds to a single thing/object/entity; in this example, each row corresponds to a movie.<br>A database is a collection of one or more tables. A database might consist of only one table, such as  movies .<br>But we can expand our database to include more tables. For example, we can add a second table,  oscars , so<br>that we have two tables in our database:<br>oscars<br>o.year o.category o.title<br>2010 Animated Feature Film Toy Story 3<br>2003 Directing The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King<br>1997 Directing Titanic<br>1997 Best Picture Titanic<br>This table gives names of movies that won Academy Awards (also knows as “The Oscars”, the year they<br>won, and the category in which they won. Notice that the names are the same ones as in the  movies table<br>above. This is no coincidence. Stay tuned.<br>The two tables  movies and  oscars is another example of a database; this database has two tables.<br>SQuEaL: Operations on Tables<br>In this section, you’ll learn the operations that can be performed on tables and how these operations are<br>written in SQuEaL. Throughout, keep one thing in mind: each operation on a table creates a new table.<br>Selecting Columns<br>One thing we can do on a table is select some or all of its columns. For example, consider the  movies table<br>(the first table given in this handout). We might be interested in only the names of the movies, so we might<br>want a table with only the  m.title column. We could express this in SQuEaL as:<br>select m.title from movies<br>and this would give us a table with just one column:<br>one column from movies<br>11/21/2016<br>3/9<br>m.title<br>Titanic<br>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King<br>Toy Story 3<br>Or maybe you want only the movie names and year (and not the studio or gross revenue). You’d express this<br>as:<br>select m.title,m.year from movies<br>and you’d get a table with two columns,  m.title and  m.year :<br>two columns from movies<br>m.year m.title<br>1997 Titanic<br>2003 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King<br>2010 Toy Story 3<br>You may have noticed that the columns in this table are in the “wrong” order. However, that doesn’t matter.<br>The order of the columns does not change the data in the table. You will see in the next section that we will<br>use dictionaries to store columns, so the order of columns is not preserved. This is expected behaviour.<br>Moving on: there are two ways to get all of the columns. You could list them all separated by commas:<br>select m.title,m.studio,m.gross,m.year from movies<br>or you can use a shorthand; the  <em> means “all columns”:<br>select </em> from movies<br>In both cases, you get a new table that contains exactly the same information as  movies .<br>Multiple Tables<br>Selecting columns from a table is nice, but it doesn’t let us use the full capacity of our data stored in the<br>database. Recall that a database can have multiple tables, and that these tables might be meaningfully related.<br>For example, our  movies table contains the name of the movie, but the  oscars table contains additional<br>information on awards that movie won (we’ll give you the data to make more related tables, such as ratings<br>and actors who starred in the various movies).<br>Look back at those two tables. It would be nice to be able to create a single table that joins those two tables<br>into one, like this:<br>movies join oscars<br>m.title m.studio m.gross o.category<br>Titanic Par. 2186.8 Directing<br>Titanic Par. 2186.8 Best Picture<br>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King NL 1119.9 Directing<br>Toy Story 3 BV 1063.2 Animated Feature Film<br>Notice that, for each row, we have some of the data from the  movies and some of the data from oscars<br>( o.category ).<br>You should be able to perform these joins by hand. The column on which we are joining the two tables is the<br>column that contains the common information. In this case, both tables have a  title column, so we join on<br>that. Consider the first row of  movies . The title of the film is Titanic, so we’re going to join with all rows of<br>the  oscars table where the  o.title is Titanic. In this case, there are two rows where  o.title is Titanic, the<br>11/21/2016<br>4/9<br>3rd and 4th (best picture and directing for 1997). Joining the first row from  movies and that third row from<br>oscars gives us the first row for our new table:<br>movies join oscars<br>m.title m.studio m.gross o.category<br>Titanic Par. 2186.8 Directing<br>The first row of  movies would also join with the 4th row of  oscars , to produce the 2nd row of our new table.<br>Likewise, the 2nd and 3rd rows of  movies would join with the 2nd and 1st rows of  oscars respectively, to<br>produce our final table.<br>Here is the SQuEaL syntax for performing the join described here:<br>select m.title,m.studio,m.gross,o.category from movies,oscars where m.title=o.title<br>You should notice two things. First, after  from , we now have the names of two tables. In addition, we have<br>added the keyword  where followed by a condition that must be true in order for a row to appear in the table.<br>m.title=o.title means that a row from the movie table can be joined to a row of the oscar table exactly<br>when the title columns are equal. (This is why we have the  m. and  o. prefixes. We can’t have two columns<br>with the same name or we wouldn’t have a way to refer uniquely to them!)<br>STOP! Make sure you understand this join stuff before continuing. Be sure you can work through questions<br>like the following, or you’ll have conceptual trouble later:<br>What if there were an oscar winner from the  oscar table that didn’t have a row in the  movies table?<br>Would that winner show up in the new table?<br>What if there were a movie in the  movies table that didn’t win any awards in the  oscars table? Would<br>that movie show up in the new table?<br>s<br>p<br>o<br>i<br>l<br>e<br>r<br>The answer to both questions is no. For example, in the second case, we’d be looking at a movie in the<br>movies table and trying to connect that row with a row in the  oscars table. But since that movie’s title isn’t in<br>oscars , we find no match, and hence can’t add a row to the join table. (believe it or not, making money<br>doesn’t mean that a movie is any good -insert your own Twilight/Michael Bay joke here-).<br>Your Tasks<br>Your task for this assignment is in three parts. In the first part, you will create objects and methods to allow<br>you to work with tables and dictionaries, then you will write functions to read a database (one or more<br>tables), finally you will write a program that accepts SQuEaL queries from the keyboard, runs them on a<br>database, and outputs the results.<br>Starter Code<br>Please download the Assignment 2 Starter Files and extract the zip archive. The archive contains starter<br>Python code files and some sample tables that constitute databases (see below).<br>Part 1: Building Table and Database Objects<br>First, you will write the code to complete the  Table and  Database classes in  database.py . You will have to<br>decide how to implement these classes, including what instance variables and methods they should have. The<br>two methods that we will insist upon both classes having is  get_dict , and  set_dict , whose DocStrings have<br>11/21/2016<br>5/9<br>already been provided, and deal with dictionary representation of tables. These methods will allow us to more<br>easily test your code. You should NOT be using these in your own code.<br>A table, is represented as a dictionary where each key is the name of a column and each value is the list of<br>items in that column from the top row to the bottom. For example, the movies dictionary would contain four<br>key/value pairs. Here is one of them: the key is  ‘m.year’ and the value is  [‘1997’,’2003’,’2010’] ,<br>another would have the key  ‘m.title’ mapped to the value  [‘Titanic’,’The Lord of the Rings: The<br>Return of the King’,’Toy Story 3’] .<br>A database can be represented as a dictionary where the keys are table names and the values are table objects.<br>Before you spend time building the methods for  Table and  Database , we suggest that you read the rest of the<br>handout so you better understand what you’ll have to do with these classes. Building sensible and well<br>thought-out methods will make your life much easier when completing the next part of the assignment.<br>Part 2: Reading Tables and Databases<br>Next, you will write some reading-related functions in  reading.py .<br>Write the following functions in  reading.py :<br>read_table: (str) -&gt; Table<br>The parameter is the name of a table file (note: this time, it’s the name of the file, and not the file<br>handle). A table file is a comma-separated file such as  movies.csv . (Do not open  csv files in Excel or<br>some other spreadsheet program. They are text files. Open them in a text editor -OTHER THAN<br>NOTEPAD- to see them.) It is your task to understand the structure of this type of file in order to read<br>it properly. The function returns a Table object.<br>read_database: () -&gt; Database<br>The database on which this function operates consists of all of the table files in the current directory.<br>These files all have an extension of  .csv . This function reads each file and returns a Database object<br>representing the data from all csv files in the current directory. For a file named  x.csv , the name of the<br>table is  x ; that is, the  .csv is not part of the table name. Note that each column name in the database is<br>guaranteed to be unique. That is, if there is a column called  x in one table, then there is guaranteed not<br>to be column  x in another table. (This is why we use the  m. -style prefixes on column names: so that our<br>column names are not shared by multiple tables in the database.)<br>How are you to obtain a list of all of the  .csv files in the directory? Use  glob.glob(‘<em>.csv’) to<br>obtain a list of these filenames. We have included this bit of code to demonstrate this for you, so you<br>are just provided with a list of the names of the files thats you need to process.<br>Note that there should be no  input and no  print in  reading.py . Two functions and that’s all. If you<br>run  reading.py and it prints something or requests user input, something is wrong.<br>Part 3: Running Queries<br>In  squeal.py , you will write a program that:<br>1. Reads the database in the current directory.<br>2. Reads SQuEaL queries from the keyboard until a blank line is entered. Each query is guaranteed to be<br>of the proper syntax. You do not need to try to verify that the query has the correct syntax; it is<br>guaranteed to be a well-formed query, and it is fine if your program crashes on malformed queries.<br>After running the query, continue with the next input prompt.<br>SQuEaL Syntax<br>11/21/2016<br>6/9<br>Here is the syntax of valid SQuEaL queries. When we speak of a token, we mean a piece of the query that<br>you get by calling  split on the query. In order, the query contains:<br>The token  select . This token is required.<br>A comma-separated list of one or more column names. There are no spaces in this list, there are no<br>duplicate column names in this list, and all columns are guaranteed to exist in the table. The special<br>token  </em> (instead of a comma-separated list of column names) means “all columns”.<br>The token  from . This token is required.<br>A comma-separated list of one or more table names. There are no spaces in this list, there are no<br>duplicate table names in this list, and all tables are guaranteed to exist in the database.<br>The token  where . This token is optional. If not present, then the query is finished here and no more<br>tokens will be present. If the token  where is present, then it is followed by a  where clause that looks<br>like this:<br>A comma-separated list of one or more constraints. There are no spaces in this list, and each<br>column mentioned in the constraints is guaranteed to exist. Each constraint is of one of the<br>following four forms:  column_name1=column_name2 ,  column_name1&gt;column_name2 ,<br>column_name1=’value’ , or  column_name1&gt;’value’ (you can also implement &lt; if you wish, but<br>we won’t be testing it). Single quotes are used to indicate that the second operand is a hard-coded<br>value rather than the value of another column in the row. Notice that there are no spaces around<br>the operators. Only these two operators are allowed. Also, note that only<br>column_name1=’value’ and  column_name1&gt;’value’ are valid,  ‘value’=column_name and<br>‘value’&gt;column_name are not valid constraints (i.e., the value can only come after the operator)<br>A Required Function:  run_query<br>We’re not specifying much in terms of required functions in  squeal.py . It is your responsibility to break the<br>work into meaningful, self-contained functions that perform well-defined and small tasks, and we will be<br>marking your design. That said, we are requiring that you write two particular functions. The first of which<br>is:<br>run_query: (Database, str) -&gt; Table<br>This function takes a Database object, and a query (in the form of a string) as its parameters. Runs the given<br>query on the given database, and returns a table representing the resulting table.<br>Another Required Function:  cartesian_product<br>The second function you must write is this:<br>cartesian_product: (Table, Table) -&gt; Table<br>The Cartesian product of two tables is a new table where each row in the first table is paired with every row<br>in the second table. For example, the Cartesian product of the  movies and  oscars tables is the following.<br>cartesian product<br>m.year m.title m.studio m.gross o.year o.category o.title<br>1997 Titanic Par. 2186.8 2010<br>Animated<br>Feature<br>Film<br>Toy Story 3<br>1997 Titanic Par. 2186.8 2003 Directing<br>The Lord of the<br>Rings: The Return<br>of the King<br>1997 Titanic Par. 2186.8 1997 Directing Titanic<br>1997 Titanic Par. 2186.8 1997<br>Best<br>Picture<br>Titanic<br>2003<br>The Lord of the Rings:<br>The Return of the King<br>NL 1119.9 2010<br>Animated<br>Feature<br>Film<br>Toy Story 3<br>11/21/2016<br>7/9<br>2003<br>The Lord of the Rings:<br>The Return of the King<br>NL 1119.9 2003 Directing<br>The Lord of the<br>Rings: The Return<br>of the King<br>2003<br>The Lord of the Rings:<br>The Return of the King<br>NL 1119.9 1997 Directing Titanic<br>2003<br>The Lord of the Rings:<br>The Return of the King<br>NL 1119.9 1997<br>Best<br>Picture<br>Titanic<br>2010 Toy Story 3 BV 1063.2 2010<br>Animated<br>Feature<br>Film<br>Toy Story 3<br>2010 Toy Story 3 BV 1063.2 2003 Directing<br>The Lord of the<br>Rings: The Return<br>of the King<br>2010 Toy Story 3 BV 1063.2 1997 Directing Titanic<br>2010 Toy Story 3 BV 1063.2 1997<br>Best<br>Picture<br>Titanic<br>Note that there are three rows in  movies and four rows in  oscars , so we get 3<em>4 = 12 rows in the cartesian<br>product table. Of course, most of these 12 rows are probably not what you want, as the titles don’t match. The<br>way that these nonsense rows get removed is through a suitable  where clause that constrains which rows are<br>kept. For example, with a  where clause of  m.title=o.title , you end up with only four rows, as expected.<br>Although it isn’t very efficient (and certainly isn’t the way things are implemented in a real database system),<br>you must process the SQuEaL query by first using your  cartesian_product function to join all the tables in<br>the query into a huge table and then keep the “good” rows and columns for the query based on the  where and<br>select clauses.<br>You may have noticed in reading the SQuEaL Syntax that one or more tables are allowed in the  from part of<br>the query. That is, you must support queries that contain one or two or three or more tables. Don’t<br>overcomplicate this. First produce the Cartesian product on the first two tables; that gives you a new table.<br>Then, do the Cartesian product on that new table and the third table in the list of tables; that gives you a new<br>table again, and so on. You can use  imdb.csv or  oscar-actors.csv in your starter files if you want to try a<br>query that involves three tables.<br>What to do with a Query<br>So, a user runs  squeal.py and types a query, like  select </em> from movies or whatever. What does your<br>program have to do to process this query?<br>The first thing you want to do is break the query into tokens by calling  split . Remember: the query is<br>guaranteed to have proper syntax!<br>Now, start with the first table after the  from ; call that your base table. If there is a second table in the tables<br>list, compute the Cartesian product of the base table and that second table; that results in another table (call it<br>t2 ). If there is a third table in the tables list, compute the Cartesian product of  t2 and that third table. Keep<br>doing this until you’ve finished with all of the tables. When you’re done, you have a table containing all of the<br>columns from all of the tables that are involved in the query.<br>Now, apply any constraints in the  where clause. Each constraint from left to right results in a new table that<br>keeps only the rows that satisfy the constraint. Processing the first constraint removes 0 or more rows;<br>processing the second constraint takes the result of the first constraint and removes a further 0 or more rows,<br>and so on. We see many opportunities for helper functions here: processing one constraint, processing all<br>constraints, finding operators, handling values vs. column names, etc.<br>Finally, create a new table where you keep only those columns that were listed after the  select . (Another<br>opportunity for good design with a helper function!) The resulting table is the result of the query. Be careful:<br>11/21/2016<br>8/9<br>even though  select is listed first in the query (it is the first token), it is the last thing you do in processing the<br>query!<br>Once you’ve generated the table for the query, you want to output that table to the screen with commas<br>separating columns. We have provided a helper function in your starter code that outputs a table in the proper<br>format.<br>When are Tables Equivalent?<br>If two tables have the same rows and the same column names, but the column order is different, then the<br>tables are equivalent.<br>Similarly, if two tables have the same rows and the same column names, but the order of the rows is different,<br>then the tables are equivalent.<br>So, you can take a table, change the order of the columns, change the order of the rows, and it will still be the<br>same table. What does this mean? It means that the order in which you add rows during a Cartesian product<br>operation doesn’t matter. As long as you have the correct rows in your table, it is fine.<br>Testing your Code<br>It is recommended that you test each function as you write it by creating small files, tables, or queries,<br>depending on the function. This is preferable to doing lots of work, finding a bug, and then having no idea<br>where in the code that bug was introduced.<br>We are not asking you to submit your testing code as part of your submission.<br>To help you test, we are also providing a type-checker. It is in your starter code ( typechecker.py ). This<br>module simply tests that the required functions accept the proper number of parameters and return the proper<br>type. Passing the type-checker says nothing of the correctness of your functions, and does not test any helper<br>functions that you have written. (We haven’t prescribed how you should write those, so we can’t test their<br>type contracts!)<br>More Examples<br>Looking for more databases on which to run your code? We’ve provided a bunch of sample  .csv files. We’ve<br>added much more detailed movie info, an olympic database, as well as a database of every type of food that<br>was mentioned in the tv show Seinfeld (some databases are more practical than others). We may add new<br>files to play with as we go, so check back periodically. If you come across some fun .csv files, feel free to let<br>me know.<br>Marking<br>These are the aspects of your work that will be marked for Assignment 2:<br>Correctness: Your functions should perform as specified.<br>Formatting style: Make sure that you follow the PEP-8 Python style guidelines, and the general<br>programming rules that we have introduced throughout the term.<br>Programming style: Your variable names should be meaningful and your code as simple and clear as<br>possible.<br>No magic numbers:: remember this from Assignment 1? You should define constants and use them<br>instead of magic numbers.<br>Commenting: be sure to include accurate docstrings (that follow the design recipe we have been<br>using) and include internal comments.<br>Design: We expect a reasonable choice of functions/methods. Functions/methods should generally be<br>short – no longer than about 20-30 lines of code. Write helper functions/methods to meet this goal.<br>11/21/2016<br>9/9<br>What to Submit<br>The very last thing you should do before submitting is to run the type-check module one last time.<br>Otherwise, you could make a small error in your final changes before submitting that causes your code to<br>receive zero for correctness. Make sure that any  print or  input statements are hidden behind  if(<strong>name</strong><br>== “<strong>main</strong>“) , or else the type-checker (and more importantly the auto-marker) will wait for input when it<br>imports your file, and pause indefinitely.<br>Submit  database.py ,  reading.py and  squeal.py . Your files must be named exactly as given here (i.e. no<br>capital letters, and please don’t change the filenames).<br><br><br></font>

This lab is a head-first introduction to programming. Here are the important things<br>to know:<br>• Don’t Panic! The most important thing that this lab is about is managing confusion. There will be<br>a lot of confusion in learning how to program. Try things and ask lots of questions!<br>• In this lab we are going to draw pictures with turtles. It’s a classic exercise for introducing new<br>programmers to code, and it can make really cool pictures!<br>• Work in pairs. We’ll do this a lot in this class. The two of you should share a laptop, and share your<br>ideas too. You will be able to upload deliverables to canvas as a group.<br>• There is just one deliverable for this lab, in section 4. Basically, you will draw a cool picture and<br>upload it to canvas.<br>2 Running your first Python program<br>In this section of the lab, we’ll download and run our first python program. Let’s start by getting the code.<br>Go to canvas and find the files for today’s lab. Save a copy of turtle lab.py to your Downloads folder.<br>Comment 1 Why save your file to the Downloads folder? For this lab, it is just somewhere easy to<br>find. In the future, feel free to use any location you prefer on your computer. Remember that the lab<br>laptops reset on every reboot, so they probably won’t be there anymore by next class.<br>Comment 2 The lab computers have both OS X and Windows installed. For our labs, we will work in<br>OS X. If your computer boots into Windows, switch operating systems by restarting the computer. Hold<br>down the ‘Option’ key when you see the grey loading screen. Let go when you see startup icons appear,<br>and choose ‘Macintosh HD’<br>The code that you downloaded, turtle lab.py, is just a text file. You can open it in any text editor,<br>like textEdit (mac) or Notepad (windows). Even better, the lab computers come with Sublime and Atom,<br>which are both programmer-oriented text editors. Most importantly, this means that they automatically<br>highlight code to make it easier to read.<br>Exercise 1 Go ahead and open turtle lab.py in a text editor. Some of the lines of code are special:<br>they are comments. Comments don’t contain any instructions for the computer; they just help other<br>programmers understand what is going on.<br>Figure out which lines are comments. How do you think you would add a new comment to the<br>program?<br>Now we want to run the program. This means telling python to read through turtle lab.py and execute<br>each instruction in order. To do this, we need to use the command line. You can open the command line by<br>clicking on the spotlight icon ( ) on the right side of the mac menu bar. Search for and open Terminal,<br>which is the mac command line.<br>Comment 3 We usually interact with computers through a mix of keyboard, mouse, and touchscreens.<br>When we want to give instructions precisely and formally, like in programming, the keyboard is often<br>most helpful. The command line is a text-based interface to the computer. We type commands, press<br>enter, and then the computer executes them.<br>1 of 4<br>CSI 100 Turtle Graphics Lab<br>The command line is like the Finder: it is always in a folder, and you can move it from one folder to<br>another. In order to run turtle lab.py, we need to navigate to the Downloads folder where we put the file.<br>The rest of this section will introduce a few command line commands to let you do this.<br>The command line always starts up in your home folder. If you type pwd (which stands for “print working<br>directory”), the command line will tell you what its courent directory is.<br>&gt; pwd<br>/Users/wilsonkl<br>Comment 4 Your command line probably actually looks more like this:<br>WC-07792:~ student$ pwd<br>/Users/student<br>This is normal. The WC-07792:~ student$ part is called the command line prompt. Since it changes<br>so much from one computer to another, when programmers communicate to each other, they usually<br>just write &gt; as a sort of standard prompt, even though no one’s prompt looks exactly like that.<br>You can also see a list of all of the files and folder that are in the current directory using ls (for “list”):<br>&gt; ls<br>Applications Library anaconda<br>Desktop Movies Documents<br>Music Downloads Pictures<br>Dropbox Public Google Drive<br>Comment 5 Your output may look slightly different depending on what files and folders are in your<br>home directory. This is what mine shows.<br>Some of these folders should look familiar, like Desktop and Documents. We want to move to the<br>Downloads folder. To do that, we’ll use the cd command (for “change directory”).<br>&gt; pwd<br>/Users/wilsonkl<br>&gt; cd Downloads<br>&gt; pwd<br>/Users/wilsonkl/Downloads<br>&gt; ls<br>turtle_lab.py<br>Now that we are here in the Downloads folder where our code is, we can tell python to run it by typing<br>&gt; python turtle_lab.py<br>Exercise 2 Follow the directions above to download a copy of turtle lab.py, open a command line,<br>navigate to the Downloads folder, and run the code.<br>Do you see an image pop up that looks like the following?<br>2 of 4<br>CSI 100 Turtle Graphics Lab<br>Comment 6 There are many other handy commands for moving around on the command line. In<br>particular, cd .. (two dots) moves up one directory, and cd (with nothing after it) takes you back to<br>your home directory.<br>3 Working with turtles<br>Imagine a small invisible turtle with a pen in its mouth. In turtle graphics, we draw pictures by giving<br>a turtle directions: “go forwards”, “turn left”, “turn right”. The instructions in turtle lab.py have the<br>turtle first go forwards 100 units, then turn left by 45 degrees, and then go forwards another 200 units.<br>t.forward(100)<br>t.left(45)<br>t.forward(200)<br>The three basic turtle commands are forward, left, and right. Using just combinations of these, you can<br>make the turtle draw some very complicated things.<br>Exercise 3 Which direction is the turtle initially facing, before it starts moving?<br>Exercise 4 Change the code in turtle lab.py to make the turtle draw a square. How would you do<br>an equilateral triangle, or a hexagon?<br>4 Your turn<br>Now it’s your turn to experiment! For some inspiration, here is a cool picture made with turtle graphics:<br>Figure 1: A turtle drawing made by repeatedly moving and turning.<br>Also, here are some other commands that you can give to your turtles:<br>3 of 4<br>CSI 100 Turtle Graphics Lab<br>penup() Tell the turtle to lift up it’s pen. It will still move as usual, but will not leave a mark.<br>pendown() Tell the turtle to put it’s pen down on the paper, so that it leaves a mark. The pen starts down<br>unless you lift it.<br>pencolor(’red’) Change the color of line that the turtle draws. Other colors work too, such as ’black’,<br>’blue’, ’magenta’, and many others.<br>pensize(10) Change the thickness of the line that the turtle draws. The default is 10, so pensize(12)<br>draws a slightly thicker line.<br>Repeating. There is a way to repeat the same commands many times without lots of copying and pasting.<br>Here is an example:<br>for i in range(10):<br>t.forward(20)<br>t.left(20)<br>This will cause turtle t to go forward 20 steps, and the turn left 20 degrees, and to repeat those actions a<br>total of 10 times. Repeating code like this is called looping.<br>Comment 7 This looping code has one line that is not indented, and then two lines that are. Inden-<br>tation is important in python, and we will talk about what it means in detail later in the course. For<br>now, know that indentation should be exactly four spaces, and that only indented lines get repeated by<br>this loop.<br>Exercise 5 (Turn in) Now it’s your turn! Draw a cool picture with your turtle. Take a screenshot<br>and upload it (as a group) to canvas.<br>4 of 4<br><br><br><br></font>

There should be no file extension after the file name<br>“README”. Your README should include the following sections:<br>Program Descriptions ( 5 points ) : Provide a high level description of what each of your programs do and<br>how you can interact with them. Make this explanation such that your grandpa or uncle or someone you know<br>who has no programming experience can understand what these programs do and how to use them. Do not<br>assume your reader is a computer science major.<br>Short Response ( 5 points ) : Answer the following questions:<br>Vim Questions:<br>1. In vim/gvim, what commands will indent N consecutive lines (starting from the cursor line) by one level<br>where the indent level is defined to be two spaces? This will take two vim commands: one to set the<br>number of spaces to indent with each indent level (default is 8), and one to actually indent N<br>consecutive lines. Likewise what command will shift N lines left (de-indent N lines)?<br>2. In vim/gvim, what command will indent an entire curly-bracket block one level, while the cursor is<br>currently on either the open or close curly bracket of the block? Likewise what command will shift an<br>entire curly-bracket block one level left (de-indent block)?<br>3. How do you open a new line below and insert (one keyboard key for both steps)?<br>Unix Question:<br>4. On the Unix command line, how can you capture (redirect) the program’s output into a file named<br>“output”?<br>Java Question:<br>5. How can you create an array of ints in Java and initialize it with the values of all single digit odd positive<br>numbers (inclusively between 0-9), all in one step/line?<br>STYLE ( 20 points )<br>Please see preview programming assignments; especially PA2’s writeup.  You will be specifically graded on<br>commenting, file headers, class and method headers, meaningful variable names, judicious use of blank lines,<br>not having more than 80 characters on a line, perfect indentation, no magic numbers/hard-coded numbers<br>other than -1, 0, +1, using setters and getters, etc (see the style section of PA2’s writeup).<br>You will lose significant points if you have static methods or static variables for the Spin100 program<br>(except, constants are okay). Instead you should create getters and setters to change the variables for an<br>object.<br>CORRECTNESS ( 70 points )<br>Start by creating your pa7 directory as usual. Then copy over the starter code from the public folder by doing<br>the following:<br>$ cp ~/../public/PA7indrome.java ~/pa7<br>$ cp ~/../public/PA7-images/<em> ~/pa7<br>Program 1: PA7indrome ( 20 Points )<br>You must use recursion and implement the methods listed below or you will lose all 20 points for this<br>program. Also,  do not edit the main() method in PA7indrome.java as it will negatively affect your grade.<br>Write a command line application that checks whether an array of strings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a<br>word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same forwards and backwards. The<br>program will take in a file as a command line argument. Each line of the file will be converted into a string,<br>where each string will be placed as an element in an arraylist then converted to an array (this part has already<br>been written for you in the main() method–do not edit anything in this method). Your task will be to then<br>determine if the array of strings is a palindrome or not (non-case sensitive). You will be using two recursive<br>methods to implement this functionality.<br>public static char[] reverse( char[] toRev ) {…}<br>● Overall goal: reverse the array of characters passed in using recursion.<br>● If the length of the character array passed in is 1, just return the array right away.<br>● Otherwise, swap the first and last characters in the array (#1-3 below)<br>● Copy the middle of the array into a new array and recursively call reverse on this new array (#4 below).<br>● Place the returned array back into the middle of the original array of characters, and return this<br>reversed array of characters (#5 below).<br>● Hint: you can use System.arraycopy() (look up the javadocs).<br>● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.<br>public static boolean isPalindrome( String[] words, int lo, int hi ) {…}<br>● Overall goal: determine if the array of strings passed in is a palindrome using recursion.<br>● Determine if the string at the low index in the words array is the reverse of the string at the high index in<br>the words array. To do so, you must use your reverse() function, after converting the string to a char<br>array and passing it in. This comparison should be non-case sensitive.<br>● If the string at the low index is indeed the reverse of the string at the high index, recurse on the<br>remaining middle portion of the array by passing modified values of the low and high index in the<br>recursive call. Otherwise, return false.<br>● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.<br>You must use these methods as they are defined above or you will lose points.<br>We will test for edge cases when grading this assignment, so it is up to you to test your program thoroughly.<br>Similar to previous assignments, your output MUST match exactly to our sample output!<br>Sample Output 1: Not a palindrome (user input in BOLD)<br>For this example, the input file is named notPalindrome. If you open the file in vim, it should look like this:<br>start<br>early<br>start<br>often<br>The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome notPalindrome<br>Input array of strings:<br>start, early, start, often<br>The file is not a palindrome.<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$<br>Sample Output 2: Odd-length palindrome (user input in BOLD)<br>Input file named oddPalindrome:<br>StArT<br>EaRlY<br>sTaRt<br>oFtEn<br>ufotofu<br>NeTfO<br>TrAtS<br>yLrAe<br>tRaTs<br>The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome oddPalindrome<br>Input array of strings:<br>StArT, EaRlY, sTaRt, oFtEn, ufotofu, NeTfO, TrAtS, yLrAe, tRaTs<br>The file is a palindrome.<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$<br>The sequence of characters in the array of Strings generated from the input file reads the same forwards and<br>backwards (non-case sensitive), so it is a palindrome.

Player 1 gets to spin the wheel first. Player 1 gets to<br>spin until they have reached over 100 points or have clicked the “Finish Player 1” button. At that point,<br>it becomes Player 2’s turn. Player 2 then gets to spin until they have reached over 100 points or have<br>clicked the “Finish Player 2” button.<br>● Once Player 2 goes over 100 points or clicks the “Finish Player 2” button, the game ends.<br>● Whichever player is closer to 100 points wins. Once a player goes over 100 points then they’ve lost. If<br>both players go over 100 points then it’s a tie. If both players have the same score, then it’s a tie.<br>Example scores and their outcomes:<br>Player 1  70  120  20  100  100  95<br>Player 2  90  110  120  100  105  100<br>Winner  Player 2  Tie  Player 1  Tie  Player 1  Player 2<br>Implementation Details:<br>This program will have two Java source files: Spin100Controller.java and Spin100Wheel.java.<br>Spin100Controller.java will be the main controller which extends WindowController and handles the GUI<br>layout. Spin100Wheel.java will be the actual wheel object that defines what a wheel can do, how it spins, etc.<br>1. Setting up the GUI:<br>Start by first getting the GUI set up in the begin() method of Spin100Controller.java.<br>The top panel will have 3 labels:<br>● “Spin100” - You can customize the font of this label–don’t worry about whether the font is the default or<br>not! Just make sure your program doesn’t throw errors or have an incorrect layout / text upon start.<br>● “Player 1’s score: “ - followed by player 1’s score (initially 0).<br>● “Player 2’s score: “ - followed by player 2’s score (initially 0).<br>○ Note the space following the ‘:’ for each player’s score<br>The bottom panel will have 5 buttons: (make sure the text matches exactly).<br>● “Click to Spin P1”<br>● “Finish Player 1”<br>● “Restart”<br>● “Click to Spin P2”<br>● “Finish Player 2”<br>The wheels on the center canvas:<br>● The center of the window will have the canvas, similar to PA6. The height and width of the canvas<br>should be 840 x 660. Note that the canvas will not be resized during testing. On the canvas we will<br>be displaying two wheels (one for each player). In order to create the wheels, we need to initialize an<br>array of Image(s), using the images you copied over from the public folder. Make sure your images<br>are directly inside your pa7 directory, and not in a subdirectory called PA7-images.<br>● You will want to load the 20 images into an array of Images. To ensure you arrange the images in the<br>correct order, we suggest creating the following array. This will ensure you load the images in the<br>correct order and will also be helpful for scoring later on. Load the images corresponding to these<br>score values in the order in which they appear in the array. The array of images and the array of score<br>values will be parallel arrays.<br>private static final int[] SCORES = { 50, 85, 30, 65, 10, 45, 70, 25, 90, 5,<br>100, 15, 80, 35, 60, 20, 40, 75, 55, 95 };<br>● The wheel should always start with 50 in the center and should spin in a downward direction. This<br>means that when the wheel spins for the first time, the red arrow will first point to 50, then 85, then 30,<br>and so on.<br>● You will want to create each wheel by calling the Spin100Wheel constructor. Some parameters you will<br>probably want to pass to the constructor are:<br>○ The array of Image(s) corresponding to the SCORES values.<br>○ Location of the wheel (location of the top number). The center of the left wheel should be<br>horizontally aligned with the center of the left half of the canvas. In other words, you need to find<br>the x-coordinate that will center the left wheel in the center of the left half of the canvas.<br>Similarly, you need to find the x-coordinate that will center the right wheel in the center of the<br>right half of the canvas. The y-coordinate of the top number for both wheels should be 10 (make<br>sure the layout of your wheels matches the screenshots exactly).<br>○ Reference to the Spin100Controller so that controller methods can be called from the wheel<br>(this will be useful for setting the score after the wheel stops spinning each time)<br>○ Reference to the drawing canvas so the wheel can be placed on the canvas<br>The red arrows on the center canvas:<br>● The arrows are red-filled arcs with start angle = -15, arc angle = 30, height = 150, and width = 150.<br>● Left arrow position: (234.5, 186.0)<br>● Right arrow position: (688.5, 186.0)<br>Messages declaring winner on the center canvas:<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “Tie” at position (444, 5). The text should be blue, bold, and size 16.<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “P1 Winner” at position (20, 5). The text should be green, bold, and<br>size 16.<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “P2 Winner” at position (808, 5). The text should be green, bold,<br>and size 16.<br>See the screenshot section below to see what all of this looks like.<br>2. Wheel Functionality<br>Because the wheels are animated, the Spin100Wheel class needs to extend ActiveObject (and therefore must<br>contain a run() method).<br>Creating a wheel:<br>● Each wheel needs an array of 5 VisibleImages (generated from the array of images passed in as a<br>parameter to the constructor) to store the 5 images that will be visible on the canvas at any given time.<br>● The location passed to the constructor is the location of the topmost VisibleImage. The next<br>VisibleImage will be 99 pixels below that, and the next 99 pixels below that, and so on.<br>● Each wheel needs a random double generator object to generate random numbers for the amount of<br>ticks to spin when the spin button is clicked (see more details below in the Spinning the wheel section).<br>● Don’t forget to save a reference to the Spin100Controller object to help with scoring.<br>● Set the number of ticks to 0, so the wheel begins stationary.<br>● As with all ActiveObjects, the last statement in the constructor should be start();.<br>Spinning the wheel:<br>● Initially, the wheel’s number of ticks should be set to zero. When a wheel’s spin button is clicked, the<br>controller should update the number of ticks so the wheel will start spinning. This means you will want<br>a method to generate a random number of ticks for the wheel to spin.<br>● One way to implement this is to have a method called getRandomTicks(). This method should:<br>○ First generate a random double between 0 and 1<br>○ Based on the random number, return the minimum number of ticks (50) + a number of<br>additional ticks, which indicates how many ticks a wheel should spin for. This is to allow the<br>wheel to stop on different numbers each time by randomizing where a wheel stops cycling<br>through the array of images.<br>○ If the random number is between 0 and 0.05, return MIN_TICKS + 1. If it’s between .05 and .1,<br>return MIN_TICKS + 2. You should keep adding one more tick until you return MIN_TICKS + 13<br>for when the value is between .6 and .65. From there you should subtract one less tick until you<br>return MIN_TICKS + 6 when the value is between .95 and 1.<br>■ Range of ticks to add (over the .05 increments) is<br>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6)<br>● After getting the random number of ticks, the controller needs to set the wheel’s number of ticks using a<br>setter method.<br>● To make the wheel actually spin, the run method will need to constantly check its number of ticks. If<br>the number of ticks is greater than 0, increment the index of each visible image displayed to the next<br>index in the images array; in other words, for every tick, shift the images down one. Once you reach<br>the last index of the images array, wrap back around to the beginning (Hint: think mod operator).<br>Then decrement the number of ticks left for this wheel to spin and pause to slow down the animation.<br>● At the beginning of each spin, the initial delay should be set to 1. Then when the wheel delay is less<br>than 20, the wheel delay should increment by 1 on every iteration of the forever loop. When the wheel<br>delay is greater than or equal to 20 and less than 200, the wheel delay should increment by 5. When<br>the wheel delay is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 500, the wheel delay should increment by<br>20. This will give the illusion of a faster spin at the start which eventually slows down and stops once<br>the number of ticks is zero.<br>● Once the number of ticks is 0, the wheel needs to call a public method in controller to let the controller<br>know that the wheel’s score has changed and that the Text object for the score needs to be updated.<br>● Some additional methods to include in the class would be setters and getters for the ticks, delay, and<br>score. This is so that the controller can call these methods and change the wheel’s variables’ values<br>when something like the spin, finish, or reset button is pressed.<br>3. Controller Functionality<br>You will implement Spin100Controller.java to handle creating the buttons and listening to actions performed on<br>the buttons.<br>● Upon start, only the “Click to Spin P1” and “Restart” buttons should be enabled. So in your begin()<br>method, in addition to setting up the layouts of the buttons, you should also disable the “Finish Player 1”<br>button and all buttons associated with Player 2.<br>● Once you have clicked “Click to Spin P1”, all buttons are disabled until the wheel stops spinning. Once<br>the wheel stops spinning, update Player 1’s score. Now that you have spun Player 1’s wheel at least<br>once, the “Finish Player 1” button should be enabled.<br>● As long as Player 1’s score is less than or equal to 100, Player 1 can choose to continue spinning by<br>clicking “Click to Spin P1” again, or click “Finish Player 1” to finish their turn. Once Player 1’s score is<br>over 100, the controller will automatically finish the turn for Player 1.<br>● Once Player 1 has finished, all of Player 1’s buttons are disabled and the “Click to Spin P2” button is<br>enabled for Player 2 to start spinning. The spinning process follows the same condition as stated for<br>Player 1.<br>● Once Player 2 has also finished, all but the Restart button should be disabled. A game over message<br>should be displayed. The message could announce a Tie, or announce that either Player 1 or Player 2<br>won (see screenshots for detail).<br>Summary of the buttons<br>● The Spin buttons: The spin button disables itself when:<br>○ The wheels are spinning<br>○ The player’s score has passed 100<br>○ The player has clicked finish after at least one spin<br>● The Finish buttons: Each player’s finish button is disabled until they have spun at least once. It is also<br>disabled when the wheel is spinning, as well as after they have finished their turn.<br>● The Restart button: This button is always enabled except when a wheel is spinning. Once clicked:<br>○ It changes the scores back to 0<br>○ It resets the wheels so that 50 is at the center again<br>○ The “Click To Spin P1” button is enabled again and the buttons are reset to the original state.<br>Implementation Requirements for Button Event Handling<br>To manage the behaviors of the 5 buttons, you must define 5 private member inner classes inside the<br>Spin100Controller class. Use your notes from class as a reference.<br>● Each private class must implement the ActionListener interface.<br>● The ActionListener interface enforces that each class has the actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method<br>declared and implemented.<br>Having separate inner classes for each button is much better than handling all button events in one<br>actionPerformed() method. This is because there is a one-to-one relationship between buttons and listeners,<br>resulting in cleaner code that is less prone to errors.<br>Note: Remember to use getters/setters vs. directly accessing variables by name.<br>4. Sample Screenshots:<br>The start of the program. Both<br>player’s scores are set to 0,<br>with the arrows pointing to 50.<br>Only the buttons: “Click to Spin<br>P1” and “Restart” are enabled.<br>After Player 1 clicks “Click to<br>Spin P1”, the score for Player<br>1 is updated. The “Finish<br>Player 1” button is now<br>enabled after 1 spin.<br>Player 1 clicks “Finish Player<br>1”, and now only “Restart” and<br>“Click to Spin P2” buttons are<br>enabled.<br>Player 2 now clicks “Click to<br>Spin P2”, the score for Player<br>2 is updated. “Finish Player 2”<br>button is now enabled after the<br>first spin.<br>After Player 2 clicks “Finish<br>Player 2” The winner text<br>appears. The only button<br>enabled is “Restart”.<br>This is the case when Player<br>1’s score is over 100, thus<br>Player 2 wins.<br>In the case that Player 1’s<br>score exceeds 100, the<br>buttons “Click to Spin P1” and<br>“Finish Player 1” are<br>automatically disabled,<br>allowing P2 to begin.<br>If both player’s scores exceed<br>100, the game results in a tie.<br>Turnin<br>To turnin your code, navigate to your home directory and run the following command:<br>&gt; cse11turnin pa7<br>You may turn in your programming assignment as many times as you like.

Set the canvas width to 1000 and the canvas height to 660.<br>Overall Wins: 1 Point<br>Keep track of the overall wins with a message that appears at the end of the game:<br>Overall Wins P1: #, P2 @<br>where # is a non-negative number indicating how many times player 1 has won the game and @ is a non-<br>negative number indicating how many times player 2 has won the game. This message cannot overlap either<br>wheel and it should be horizontally centered between the wheels. It should be 200 pixels above the vertical<br>center of the canvas. The message can be in whatever color you would like besides black. In the case of a tie,<br>neither player’s win count should change.<br>Change Spin Direction: 1 Point<br>Add some new buttons and change the old ones so that each player has the option to spin up or down. There<br>should be a “P1, Spin Up” button, “P1, Spin Down” button, “P2, Spin Up” button, and “P2, Spin Down” button.<br>To clarify, spinning up is where the numbers appear to be moving up (so the 50 goes towards the top) whereas<br>spinning down is where the numbers appear to be moving down (so the 50 moves towards the bottom). You<br>can see the new buttons in the screenshots below. Disabling the buttons should still work the same as it does<br>in the normal portion of the PA, just make sure to disable both the Up and Down spin buttons.<br>Switch Starting Players: 3 Points<br>The “Switch” button is enabled only at the start of each round of the game. This button should be disabled in<br>the middle of a game (i.e. if a spin has occurred). This allows the player who spins first to switch with the other<br>player. For instance, if Player 1 was going to start first and the switch button is clicked. then the game will<br>restart and Player 2 will now start first. If the restart button were then clicked, Player 2 would still be going first.<br>Sample Screenshots:<br>If all extra credit features are implemented, this is the initial state of the program.<br>The overall number of wins for each player is shown when a round finishes.<br>Player 2 can begin the round of a game when “Switch” is clicked.<br><br><br></font>
