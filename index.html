The grid will have a pre-designated “goal”<br>position to be found. The bot will move about on the grid using a fixed set of simple commands<br>that are provided to the Bot at its construction. There will be a time limit as to how long the<br>simulation of the bot on the grid is allowed. The simulation ends when either the Bot finds the<br>goal or when the limit of simulation steps is reached.<br>Grid<br>The grid is a square with individual coordinates that we designate as (x,y) that contains a goal<br>position. We assume that the bottom left corner of the grid is (0,0) and that y is the vertical<br>direction and x the horizontal direction. Both x and y are greater than or equal to 0. Both the<br>dimensions of the grid and the goal position are provided as input, and we guarantee that the<br>provided goal position is within the grid. There is no wrap-around on this grid. Like a Roomba<br>bot, if a bot moves forward/backward into a wall, its position remains unchanged (it bumps into<br>the wall and cannot finish the move) and it moves on to executing its next command.<br>Bot<br>The bot is very simple, similar to a turtle graphics turtle. A bot has:<br>• a position in x,y coordinates (the grid)<br>o the initial position is provided as input, guaranteed to fit on the grid<br>• a direction the bot faces, represented by four characters: nàNorth, sàSouth, eàEast,<br>wàWest.<br>o the initial direction is provided as input.<br>• four commands it can respond to, also represented as characters:<br>o l à turn left, r à turn right. The turns do not change the position of the bot, only<br>its facing direction. A turn results in a change of facing direction to one of the<br>four cardinal directions: n, s, e, w. Thus if the bot is facing west and turns left, it<br>will now be facing south without a change of position.<br>o f à forward, b à backward, move bot one space, forward or backward, in the<br>direction it is facing. If the bot cannot move because of an obstruction of a wall,<br>then its position does not change.<br>o A single string is provided that is a sequence of some combination of these<br>commands. For example “fblr” is a command sequence. The command string is a<br>sequence that is repeated. That is, once ‘f’, ‘b’, ‘l’, ‘r’ are each executed, execution<br>begins again at the start of the sequence, executing ‘f’.<br>o<br>Assignment Overview<br>The main program will read in:<br>• 3 parameters for a Grid: its dimensions and the x and y positions of the goal<br>• 4 parameters for the Bot: its initial position as x and y, its initial direction and its<br>command string.<br>• a limit for the number of Bot steps to be taken<br>The main loop will execute as long as the goal has not yet been reached and as long as the<br>number of Bot steps is less than the limit.<br>At each Bot step:<br>• the Bot will execute its next command.<br>• the count of Bot steps executed will be updated.<br>At the end (by limit or by reaching the goal, either one), the main will print the final position of<br>the Bot and whether it had reached its goal.<br>Class public elements<br>You can design the private elements of your class anyway you like. That is, whatever underlying<br>data structures you would like in your class, do it.<br>I’ll give you the public method declarations (not the definitions L) I used to make the class.<br>They will be on hackerrank as well. These are “good ideas”, but it is up to you. The ones that<br>absolutely have to be there , because they are in the main program, are:<br>• all the constructors (all of them, how many are there???)<br>• Bot’s execute_command<br>• Bot’s overloaded operator&lt;&lt;<br>• Bot’s at_goal<br>class Grid{<br>private:<br>// data members you need go here<br>public:<br>Grid()=default;<br>Grid(size_t, size_t, size_t);<br>friend class Bot;<br>};<br>// Grid function members here<br>class Bot{<br>private:<br>// data members you need go here<br>public:<br>Bot()=default;<br>Bot(size_t, size_t, char, string, Grid&amp;);<br>void forward();<br>void back();<br>void left();<br>void right();<br>void execute_command();<br>bool at_goal();<br>friend ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp;,Bot&amp;);<br>};<br>// Bot function members here<br>Things to note<br>• A Grid instance is a parameter to the Bot constructor. Why is that? The Grid knows its<br>dimensions and it knows the position of the goal. The Bot can inquire of those values, which<br>it needs, through its Grid instance.<br>• Grid needs to come before Bot, since Bot needs a Grid in its construction.<br>• The Grid is a friend class of the Bot. That means that the Bot has access to the private data<br>members of the Grid. That will make the code a little easier to write.<br>• There is a friend function for printing a Bot. It has a very particular format to pass<br>hackerrank, which is<br>o (x,y) facing:d Where x,y are its position and d is the direction, a single<br>character. Get it right!<br>• There is a commented line in the main loop to print the Bot at the beginning of each cycle.<br>You should use that (and other output as well) to track how you are doing.<br>• Do whatever you like to main, but in the end you should turn in the single file with the main<br>exactly as we showed you in the beginning.<br>Deliverables<br>You must use Handin to turn in the file proj08.cpp – this is your source code solution; be sure to<br>include your section, the date, the project number and comments describing your code. You can<br>check your results using hackerrank as before.<br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>Turtle乌龟画图的初级入门作业，总共5个exercise，包括运行python运行，用命令行操作，画图形等等入门功能<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>CSI 100 Turtle Graphics Lab<br>1 Introduction<br>Welcome to CSI100! This lab is a head-first introduction to programming. Here are the important things<br>to know:<br>• Don’t Panic! The most important thing that this lab is about is managing confusion. There will be<br>a lot of confusion in learning how to program. Try things and ask lots of questions!<br>• In this lab we are going to draw pictures with turtles. It’s a classic exercise for introducing new<br>programmers to code, and it can make really cool pictures!<br>• Work in pairs. We’ll do this a lot in this class. The two of you should share a laptop, and share your<br>ideas too. You will be able to upload deliverables to canvas as a group.<br>• There is just one deliverable for this lab, in section 4. Basically, you will draw a cool picture and<br>upload it to canvas.<br>2 Running your first Python program<br>In this section of the lab, we’ll download and run our first python program. Let’s start by getting the code.<br>Go to canvas and find the files for today’s lab. Save a copy of turtle lab.py to your Downloads folder.<br>Comment 1 Why save your file to the Downloads folder? For this lab, it is just somewhere easy to<br>find. In the future, feel free to use any location you prefer on your computer. Remember that the lab<br>laptops reset on every reboot, so they probably won’t be there anymore by next class.<br>Comment 2 The lab computers have both OS X and Windows installed. For our labs, we will work in<br>OS X. If your computer boots into Windows, switch operating systems by restarting the computer. Hold<br>down the ‘Option’ key when you see the grey loading screen. Let go when you see startup icons appear,<br>and choose ‘Macintosh HD’<br>The code that you downloaded, turtle lab.py, is just a text file. You can open it in any text editor,<br>like textEdit (mac) or Notepad (windows). Even better, the lab computers come with Sublime and Atom,<br>which are both programmer-oriented text editors. Most importantly, this means that they automatically<br>highlight code to make it easier to read.<br>Exercise 1 Go ahead and open turtle lab.py in a text editor. Some of the lines of code are special:<br>they are comments. Comments don’t contain any instructions for the computer; they just help other<br>programmers understand what is going on.<br>Figure out which lines are comments. How do you think you would add a new comment to the<br>program?<br>Now we want to run the program. This means telling python to read through turtle lab.py and execute<br>each instruction in order. To do this, we need to use the command line. You can open the command line by<br>clicking on the spotlight icon ( ) on the right side of the mac menu bar. Search for and open Terminal,<br>which is the mac command line.<br>Comment 3 We usually interact with computers through a mix of keyboard, mouse, and touchscreens.<br>When we want to give instructions precisely and formally, like in programming, the keyboard is often<br>most helpful. The command line is a text-based interface to the computer. We type commands, press<br>enter, and then the computer executes them.<br>1 of 4<br>CSI 100 Turtle Graphics Lab<br>The command line is like the Finder: it is always in a folder, and you can move it from one folder to<br>another. In order to run turtle lab.py, we need to navigate to the Downloads folder where we put the file.<br>The rest of this section will introduce a few command line commands to let you do this.<br>The command line always starts up in your home folder. If you type pwd (which stands for “print working<br>directory”), the command line will tell you what its courent directory is.<br>&gt; pwd<br>/Users/wilsonkl<br>Comment 4 Your command line probably actually looks more like this:<br>WC-07792:~ student$ pwd<br>/Users/student<br>This is normal. The WC-07792:~ student$ part is called the command line prompt. Since it changes<br>so much from one computer to another, when programmers communicate to each other, they usually<br>just write &gt; as a sort of standard prompt, even though no one’s prompt looks exactly like that.<br>You can also see a list of all of the files and folder that are in the current directory using ls (for “list”):<br>&gt; ls<br>Applications Library anaconda<br>Desktop Movies Documents<br>Music Downloads Pictures<br>Dropbox Public Google Drive<br>Comment 5 Your output may look slightly different depending on what files and folders are in your<br>home directory. This is what mine shows.<br>Some of these folders should look familiar, like Desktop and Documents. We want to move to the<br>Downloads folder. To do that, we’ll use the cd command (for “change directory”).<br>&gt; pwd<br>/Users/wilsonkl<br>&gt; cd Downloads<br>&gt; pwd<br>/Users/wilsonkl/Downloads<br>&gt; ls<br>turtle_lab.py<br>Now that we are here in the Downloads folder where our code is, we can tell python to run it by typing<br>&gt; python turtle_lab.py<br>Exercise 2 Follow the directions above to download a copy of turtle lab.py, open a command line,<br>navigate to the Downloads folder, and run the code.<br>Do you see an image pop up that looks like the following?<br>2 of 4<br>CSI 100 Turtle Graphics Lab<br>Comment 6 There are many other handy commands for moving around on the command line. In<br>particular, cd .. (two dots) moves up one directory, and cd (with nothing after it) takes you back to<br>your home directory.<br>3 Working with turtles<br>Imagine a small invisible turtle with a pen in its mouth. In turtle graphics, we draw pictures by giving<br>a turtle directions: “go forwards”, “turn left”, “turn right”. The instructions in turtle lab.py have the<br>turtle first go forwards 100 units, then turn left by 45 degrees, and then go forwards another 200 units.<br>t.forward(100)<br>t.left(45)<br>t.forward(200)<br>The three basic turtle commands are forward, left, and right. Using just combinations of these, you can<br>make the turtle draw some very complicated things.<br>Exercise 3 Which direction is the turtle initially facing, before it starts moving?<br>Exercise 4 Change the code in turtle lab.py to make the turtle draw a square. How would you do<br>an equilateral triangle, or a hexagon?<br>4 Your turn<br>Now it’s your turn to experiment! For some inspiration, here is a cool picture made with turtle graphics:<br>Figure 1: A turtle drawing made by repeatedly moving and turning.<br>Also, here are some other commands that you can give to your turtles:<br>3 of 4<br>CSI 100 Turtle Graphics Lab<br>penup() Tell the turtle to lift up it’s pen. It will still move as usual, but will not leave a mark.<br>pendown() Tell the turtle to put it’s pen down on the paper, so that it leaves a mark. The pen starts down<br>unless you lift it.<br>pencolor(’red’) Change the color of line that the turtle draws. Other colors work too, such as ’black’,<br>’blue’, ’magenta’, and many others.<br>pensize(10) Change the thickness of the line that the turtle draws. The default is 10, so pensize(12)<br>draws a slightly thicker line.<br>Repeating. There is a way to repeat the same commands many times without lots of copying and pasting.<br>Here is an example:<br>for i in range(10):<br>t.forward(20)<br>t.left(20)<br>This will cause turtle t to go forward 20 steps, and the turn left 20 degrees, and to repeat those actions a<br>total of 10 times. Repeating code like this is called looping.<br>Comment 7 This looping code has one line that is not indented, and then two lines that are. Inden-<br>tation is important in python, and we will talk about what it means in detail later in the course. For<br>now, know that indentation should be exactly four spaces, and that only indented lines get repeated by<br>this loop.<br>Exercise 5 (Turn in) Now it’s your turn! Draw a cool picture with your turtle. Take a screenshot<br>and upload it (as a group) to canvas.<br>4 of 4<br><br><br><br></font>

There should be no file extension after the file name<br>“README”. Your README should include the following sections:<br>Program Descriptions ( 5 points ) : Provide a high level description of what each of your programs do and<br>how you can interact with them. Make this explanation such that your grandpa or uncle or someone you know<br>who has no programming experience can understand what these programs do and how to use them. Do not<br>assume your reader is a computer science major.<br>Short Response ( 5 points ) : Answer the following questions:<br>Vim Questions:<br>1. In vim/gvim, what commands will indent N consecutive lines (starting from the cursor line) by one level<br>where the indent level is defined to be two spaces? This will take two vim commands: one to set the<br>number of spaces to indent with each indent level (default is 8), and one to actually indent N<br>consecutive lines. Likewise what command will shift N lines left (de-indent N lines)?<br>2. In vim/gvim, what command will indent an entire curly-bracket block one level, while the cursor is<br>currently on either the open or close curly bracket of the block? Likewise what command will shift an<br>entire curly-bracket block one level left (de-indent block)?<br>3. How do you open a new line below and insert (one keyboard key for both steps)?<br>Unix Question:<br>4. On the Unix command line, how can you capture (redirect) the program’s output into a file named<br>“output”?<br>Java Question:<br>5. How can you create an array of ints in Java and initialize it with the values of all single digit odd positive<br>numbers (inclusively between 0-9), all in one step/line?<br>STYLE ( 20 points )<br>Please see preview programming assignments; especially PA2’s writeup.  You will be specifically graded on<br>commenting, file headers, class and method headers, meaningful variable names, judicious use of blank lines,<br>not having more than 80 characters on a line, perfect indentation, no magic numbers/hard-coded numbers<br>other than -1, 0, +1, using setters and getters, etc (see the style section of PA2’s writeup).<br>You will lose significant points if you have static methods or static variables for the Spin100 program<br>(except, constants are okay). Instead you should create getters and setters to change the variables for an<br>object.<br>CORRECTNESS ( 70 points )<br>Start by creating your pa7 directory as usual. Then copy over the starter code from the public folder by doing<br>the following:<br>$ cp ~/../public/PA7indrome.java ~/pa7<br>$ cp ~/../public/PA7-images/<em> ~/pa7<br>Program 1: PA7indrome ( 20 Points )<br>You must use recursion and implement the methods listed below or you will lose all 20 points for this<br>program. Also,  do not edit the main() method in PA7indrome.java as it will negatively affect your grade.<br>Write a command line application that checks whether an array of strings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a<br>word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same forwards and backwards. The<br>program will take in a file as a command line argument. Each line of the file will be converted into a string,<br>where each string will be placed as an element in an arraylist then converted to an array (this part has already<br>been written for you in the main() method–do not edit anything in this method). Your task will be to then<br>determine if the array of strings is a palindrome or not (non-case sensitive). You will be using two recursive<br>methods to implement this functionality.<br>public static char[] reverse( char[] toRev ) {…}<br>● Overall goal: reverse the array of characters passed in using recursion.<br>● If the length of the character array passed in is 1, just return the array right away.<br>● Otherwise, swap the first and last characters in the array (#1-3 below)<br>● Copy the middle of the array into a new array and recursively call reverse on this new array (#4 below).<br>● Place the returned array back into the middle of the original array of characters, and return this<br>reversed array of characters (#5 below).<br>● Hint: you can use System.arraycopy() (look up the javadocs).<br>● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.<br>public static boolean isPalindrome( String[] words, int lo, int hi ) {…}<br>● Overall goal: determine if the array of strings passed in is a palindrome using recursion.<br>● Determine if the string at the low index in the words array is the reverse of the string at the high index in<br>the words array. To do so, you must use your reverse() function, after converting the string to a char<br>array and passing it in. This comparison should be non-case sensitive.<br>● If the string at the low index is indeed the reverse of the string at the high index, recurse on the<br>remaining middle portion of the array by passing modified values of the low and high index in the<br>recursive call. Otherwise, return false.<br>● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.<br>You must use these methods as they are defined above or you will lose points.<br>We will test for edge cases when grading this assignment, so it is up to you to test your program thoroughly.<br>Similar to previous assignments, your output MUST match exactly to our sample output!<br>Sample Output 1: Not a palindrome (user input in BOLD)<br>For this example, the input file is named notPalindrome. If you open the file in vim, it should look like this:<br>start<br>early<br>start<br>often<br>The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome notPalindrome<br>Input array of strings:<br>start, early, start, often<br>The file is not a palindrome.<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$<br>Sample Output 2: Odd-length palindrome (user input in BOLD)<br>Input file named oddPalindrome:<br>StArT<br>EaRlY<br>sTaRt<br>oFtEn<br>ufotofu<br>NeTfO<br>TrAtS<br>yLrAe<br>tRaTs<br>The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome oddPalindrome<br>Input array of strings:<br>StArT, EaRlY, sTaRt, oFtEn, ufotofu, NeTfO, TrAtS, yLrAe, tRaTs<br>The file is a palindrome.<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$<br>The sequence of characters in the array of Strings generated from the input file reads the same forwards and<br>backwards (non-case sensitive), so it is a palindrome.

Player 1 gets to spin the wheel first. Player 1 gets to<br>spin until they have reached over 100 points or have clicked the “Finish Player 1” button. At that point,<br>it becomes Player 2’s turn. Player 2 then gets to spin until they have reached over 100 points or have<br>clicked the “Finish Player 2” button.<br>● Once Player 2 goes over 100 points or clicks the “Finish Player 2” button, the game ends.<br>● Whichever player is closer to 100 points wins. Once a player goes over 100 points then they’ve lost. If<br>both players go over 100 points then it’s a tie. If both players have the same score, then it’s a tie.<br>Example scores and their outcomes:<br>Player 1  70  120  20  100  100  95<br>Player 2  90  110  120  100  105  100<br>Winner  Player 2  Tie  Player 1  Tie  Player 1  Player 2<br>Implementation Details:<br>This program will have two Java source files: Spin100Controller.java and Spin100Wheel.java.<br>Spin100Controller.java will be the main controller which extends WindowController and handles the GUI<br>layout. Spin100Wheel.java will be the actual wheel object that defines what a wheel can do, how it spins, etc.<br>1. Setting up the GUI:<br>Start by first getting the GUI set up in the begin() method of Spin100Controller.java.<br>The top panel will have 3 labels:<br>● “Spin100” - You can customize the font of this label–don’t worry about whether the font is the default or<br>not! Just make sure your program doesn’t throw errors or have an incorrect layout / text upon start.<br>● “Player 1’s score: “ - followed by player 1’s score (initially 0).<br>● “Player 2’s score: “ - followed by player 2’s score (initially 0).<br>○ Note the space following the ‘:’ for each player’s score<br>The bottom panel will have 5 buttons: (make sure the text matches exactly).<br>● “Click to Spin P1”<br>● “Finish Player 1”<br>● “Restart”<br>● “Click to Spin P2”<br>● “Finish Player 2”<br>The wheels on the center canvas:<br>● The center of the window will have the canvas, similar to PA6. The height and width of the canvas<br>should be 840 x 660. Note that the canvas will not be resized during testing. On the canvas we will<br>be displaying two wheels (one for each player). In order to create the wheels, we need to initialize an<br>array of Image(s), using the images you copied over from the public folder. Make sure your images<br>are directly inside your pa7 directory, and not in a subdirectory called PA7-images.<br>● You will want to load the 20 images into an array of Images. To ensure you arrange the images in the<br>correct order, we suggest creating the following array. This will ensure you load the images in the<br>correct order and will also be helpful for scoring later on. Load the images corresponding to these<br>score values in the order in which they appear in the array. The array of images and the array of score<br>values will be parallel arrays.<br>private static final int[] SCORES = { 50, 85, 30, 65, 10, 45, 70, 25, 90, 5,<br>100, 15, 80, 35, 60, 20, 40, 75, 55, 95 };<br>● The wheel should always start with 50 in the center and should spin in a downward direction. This<br>means that when the wheel spins for the first time, the red arrow will first point to 50, then 85, then 30,<br>and so on.<br>● You will want to create each wheel by calling the Spin100Wheel constructor. Some parameters you will<br>probably want to pass to the constructor are:<br>○ The array of Image(s) corresponding to the SCORES values.<br>○ Location of the wheel (location of the top number). The center of the left wheel should be<br>horizontally aligned with the center of the left half of the canvas. In other words, you need to find<br>the x-coordinate that will center the left wheel in the center of the left half of the canvas.<br>Similarly, you need to find the x-coordinate that will center the right wheel in the center of the<br>right half of the canvas. The y-coordinate of the top number for both wheels should be 10 (make<br>sure the layout of your wheels matches the screenshots exactly).<br>○ Reference to the Spin100Controller so that controller methods can be called from the wheel<br>(this will be useful for setting the score after the wheel stops spinning each time)<br>○ Reference to the drawing canvas so the wheel can be placed on the canvas<br>The red arrows on the center canvas:<br>● The arrows are red-filled arcs with start angle = -15, arc angle = 30, height = 150, and width = 150.<br>● Left arrow position: (234.5, 186.0)<br>● Right arrow position: (688.5, 186.0)<br>Messages declaring winner on the center canvas:<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “Tie” at position (444, 5). The text should be blue, bold, and size 16.<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “P1 Winner” at position (20, 5). The text should be green, bold, and<br>size 16.<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “P2 Winner” at position (808, 5). The text should be green, bold,<br>and size 16.<br>See the screenshot section below to see what all of this looks like.<br>2. Wheel Functionality<br>Because the wheels are animated, the Spin100Wheel class needs to extend ActiveObject (and therefore must<br>contain a run() method).<br>Creating a wheel:<br>● Each wheel needs an array of 5 VisibleImages (generated from the array of images passed in as a<br>parameter to the constructor) to store the 5 images that will be visible on the canvas at any given time.<br>● The location passed to the constructor is the location of the topmost VisibleImage. The next<br>VisibleImage will be 99 pixels below that, and the next 99 pixels below that, and so on.<br>● Each wheel needs a random double generator object to generate random numbers for the amount of<br>ticks to spin when the spin button is clicked (see more details below in the Spinning the wheel section).<br>● Don’t forget to save a reference to the Spin100Controller object to help with scoring.<br>● Set the number of ticks to 0, so the wheel begins stationary.<br>● As with all ActiveObjects, the last statement in the constructor should be start();.<br>Spinning the wheel:<br>● Initially, the wheel’s number of ticks should be set to zero. When a wheel’s spin button is clicked, the<br>controller should update the number of ticks so the wheel will start spinning. This means you will want<br>a method to generate a random number of ticks for the wheel to spin.<br>● One way to implement this is to have a method called getRandomTicks(). This method should:<br>○ First generate a random double between 0 and 1<br>○ Based on the random number, return the minimum number of ticks (50) + a number of<br>additional ticks, which indicates how many ticks a wheel should spin for. This is to allow the<br>wheel to stop on different numbers each time by randomizing where a wheel stops cycling<br>through the array of images.<br>○ If the random number is between 0 and 0.05, return MIN_TICKS + 1. If it’s between .05 and .1,<br>return MIN_TICKS + 2. You should keep adding one more tick until you return MIN_TICKS + 13<br>for when the value is between .6 and .65. From there you should subtract one less tick until you<br>return MIN_TICKS + 6 when the value is between .95 and 1.<br>■ Range of ticks to add (over the .05 increments) is<br>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6)<br>● After getting the random number of ticks, the controller needs to set the wheel’s number of ticks using a<br>setter method.<br>● To make the wheel actually spin, the run method will need to constantly check its number of ticks. If<br>the number of ticks is greater than 0, increment the index of each visible image displayed to the next<br>index in the images array; in other words, for every tick, shift the images down one. Once you reach<br>the last index of the images array, wrap back around to the beginning (Hint: think mod operator).<br>Then decrement the number of ticks left for this wheel to spin and pause to slow down the animation.<br>● At the beginning of each spin, the initial delay should be set to 1. Then when the wheel delay is less<br>than 20, the wheel delay should increment by 1 on every iteration of the forever loop. When the wheel<br>delay is greater than or equal to 20 and less than 200, the wheel delay should increment by 5. When<br>the wheel delay is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 500, the wheel delay should increment by<br>20. This will give the illusion of a faster spin at the start which eventually slows down and stops once<br>the number of ticks is zero.<br>● Once the number of ticks is 0, the wheel needs to call a public method in controller to let the controller<br>know that the wheel’s score has changed and that the Text object for the score needs to be updated.<br>● Some additional methods to include in the class would be setters and getters for the ticks, delay, and<br>score. This is so that the controller can call these methods and change the wheel’s variables’ values<br>when something like the spin, finish, or reset button is pressed.<br>3. Controller Functionality<br>You will implement Spin100Controller.java to handle creating the buttons and listening to actions performed on<br>the buttons.<br>● Upon start, only the “Click to Spin P1” and “Restart” buttons should be enabled. So in your begin()<br>method, in addition to setting up the layouts of the buttons, you should also disable the “Finish Player 1”<br>button and all buttons associated with Player 2.<br>● Once you have clicked “Click to Spin P1”, all buttons are disabled until the wheel stops spinning. Once<br>the wheel stops spinning, update Player 1’s score. Now that you have spun Player 1’s wheel at least<br>once, the “Finish Player 1” button should be enabled.<br>● As long as Player 1’s score is less than or equal to 100, Player 1 can choose to continue spinning by<br>clicking “Click to Spin P1” again, or click “Finish Player 1” to finish their turn. Once Player 1’s score is<br>over 100, the controller will automatically finish the turn for Player 1.<br>● Once Player 1 has finished, all of Player 1’s buttons are disabled and the “Click to Spin P2” button is<br>enabled for Player 2 to start spinning. The spinning process follows the same condition as stated for<br>Player 1.<br>● Once Player 2 has also finished, all but the Restart button should be disabled. A game over message<br>should be displayed. The message could announce a Tie, or announce that either Player 1 or Player 2<br>won (see screenshots for detail).<br>Summary of the buttons<br>● The Spin buttons: The spin button disables itself when:<br>○ The wheels are spinning<br>○ The player’s score has passed 100<br>○ The player has clicked finish after at least one spin<br>● The Finish buttons: Each player’s finish button is disabled until they have spun at least once. It is also<br>disabled when the wheel is spinning, as well as after they have finished their turn.<br>● The Restart button: This button is always enabled except when a wheel is spinning. Once clicked:<br>○ It changes the scores back to 0<br>○ It resets the wheels so that 50 is at the center again<br>○ The “Click To Spin P1” button is enabled again and the buttons are reset to the original state.<br>Implementation Requirements for Button Event Handling<br>To manage the behaviors of the 5 buttons, you must define 5 private member inner classes inside the<br>Spin100Controller class. Use your notes from class as a reference.<br>● Each private class must implement the ActionListener interface.<br>● The ActionListener interface enforces that each class has the actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method<br>declared and implemented.<br>Having separate inner classes for each button is much better than handling all button events in one<br>actionPerformed() method. This is because there is a one-to-one relationship between buttons and listeners,<br>resulting in cleaner code that is less prone to errors.<br>Note: Remember to use getters/setters vs. directly accessing variables by name.<br>4. Sample Screenshots:<br>The start of the program. Both<br>player’s scores are set to 0,<br>with the arrows pointing to 50.<br>Only the buttons: “Click to Spin<br>P1” and “Restart” are enabled.<br>After Player 1 clicks “Click to<br>Spin P1”, the score for Player<br>1 is updated. The “Finish<br>Player 1” button is now<br>enabled after 1 spin.<br>Player 1 clicks “Finish Player<br>1”, and now only “Restart” and<br>“Click to Spin P2” buttons are<br>enabled.<br>Player 2 now clicks “Click to<br>Spin P2”, the score for Player<br>2 is updated. “Finish Player 2”<br>button is now enabled after the<br>first spin.<br>After Player 2 clicks “Finish<br>Player 2” The winner text<br>appears. The only button<br>enabled is “Restart”.<br>This is the case when Player<br>1’s score is over 100, thus<br>Player 2 wins.<br>In the case that Player 1’s<br>score exceeds 100, the<br>buttons “Click to Spin P1” and<br>“Finish Player 1” are<br>automatically disabled,<br>allowing P2 to begin.<br>If both player’s scores exceed<br>100, the game results in a tie.<br>Turnin<br>To turnin your code, navigate to your home directory and run the following command:<br>&gt; cse11turnin pa7<br>You may turn in your programming assignment as many times as you like.

We will not take any late files you<br>forgot to turn in. Verify will help you check which files you have successfully submitted.<br>It is your responsibility to make sure you properly turned in your assignment.<br>Files to be collected:<br>Note: You must turn in all the files necessary for your program to run, including the .jar files and .png files.<br>Note: Also, if any exceptions are thrown in the terminal, you will lose points.<br>Source Files:  Image Files:  Misc:<br>PA7indrome.java<br>Spin100Controller.java<br>Spin100Wheel.java

Set the canvas width to 1000 and the canvas height to 660.<br>Overall Wins: 1 Point<br>Keep track of the overall wins with a message that appears at the end of the game:<br>Overall Wins P1: #, P2 @<br>where # is a non-negative number indicating how many times player 1 has won the game and @ is a non-<br>negative number indicating how many times player 2 has won the game. This message cannot overlap either<br>wheel and it should be horizontally centered between the wheels. It should be 200 pixels above the vertical<br>center of the canvas. The message can be in whatever color you would like besides black. In the case of a tie,<br>neither player’s win count should change.<br>Change Spin Direction: 1 Point<br>Add some new buttons and change the old ones so that each player has the option to spin up or down. There<br>should be a “P1, Spin Up” button, “P1, Spin Down” button, “P2, Spin Up” button, and “P2, Spin Down” button.<br>To clarify, spinning up is where the numbers appear to be moving up (so the 50 goes towards the top) whereas<br>spinning down is where the numbers appear to be moving down (so the 50 moves towards the bottom). You<br>can see the new buttons in the screenshots below. Disabling the buttons should still work the same as it does<br>in the normal portion of the PA, just make sure to disable both the Up and Down spin buttons.<br>Switch Starting Players: 3 Points<br>The “Switch” button is enabled only at the start of each round of the game. This button should be disabled in<br>the middle of a game (i.e. if a spin has occurred). This allows the player who spins first to switch with the other<br>player. For instance, if Player 1 was going to start first and the switch button is clicked. then the game will<br>restart and Player 2 will now start first. If the restart button were then clicked, Player 2 would still be going first.<br>Sample Screenshots:<br>If all extra credit features are implemented, this is the initial state of the program.<br>The overall number of wins for each player is shown when a round finishes.<br>Player 2 can begin the round of a game when “Switch” is clicked.<br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>中级难度<br><br>完成意大利儿童纸牌游戏的完整版。居于上一次作业的重构和改进，主要游戏的游戏规则，<br>根据规则写相关的操作逻辑，并且完成测试。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>CS1210 Computer Science I: Foundations<br>Homework 5: Ruba Mazzetto, Completed<br>Due Monday, October 31 at 11:59PM<br>Introduction<br>In Homework 4, you completed the simple implementation of the Italian children’s card game called<br>Ruba Mazzetto. In this homework, we’ll finally finish the complete version of the game that pits you<br>against any number of other players, and includes provisions for taking more than one card each turn. In<br>the interest of brevity, you can refer to the descriptions of Homework 3 and Homework 4 for more<br>information about the game.<br>Background<br>For this assignment, we’ll start with a refactored version of the Homework 4 solution, that incorporates<br>one small change to the rules of the game 1 and significantly revamps the structure of the play() function.<br>Your job is to complete this refactored version to support taking more than one card per turn, where the<br>cards matched must sum to the value of the card played. So, for example, the solution to Homework 5 will<br>behave as follows (excerpt taken from the middle of a 3-player game):<br>Pl aye r 0 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 1] 7♠ (<em>3) , [P l aye r 2] 6♥ (</em>2)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦, [4] 3♦<br>My hand : [0] 10♣, [1] 10♠<br>Pl ay wh i ch ca rd? 0<br>Se l ec t ma t ch i ng i nd ece s sepa r a t ed by spa c es (b l ank t o d i sca rd) : 1 4<br>Pl aye r 0 p l ays 10♣ and . . .<br>. . . . t ake s 3♦ f rom t ab l e<br>. . . . s t ea l s p l aye r 1 s t ash 7♠<br>=========<br>Pl aye r 1 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 0] 10♣ (<em>5) , [P l aye r 2] 6♥ (</em>2)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦<br>Pl aye r 1 p l ays 6♦ and . . .<br>. . . . s t ea l s p l aye r 2 s t ash 6♥<br>=========<br>Pl aye r 2 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 0] 10♣ (<em>5) , [P l aye r 1] 6♦ (</em>3)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦<br>Pl aye r 2 add s 1♦ t o t ab l e<br>1<br>The small change referred to here has to do with what happens to the cards that remain on the table at the end<br>of the game. In the ‘‘real’’ version of the game, the last person to match cards from the table or another player’s<br>stash is gifted all of the remaining cards on the table when everyone else has finished playing their cards. This<br>change has been incorporated into the play() function.<br>1 Revised October 24, 2016<br>Note how Player 0 uses the 10♣ to match a 3♦ from the table and the 7♣ from Player 1’s stash (because<br>10 = 3 + 7).<br>As for HW4, to make this homework feasible, you will be provided a code skeleton containing nearly all<br>of the code you will need for the solution. Your assignment is to complete the functions getMove() and<br>pickMove(), but you should begin by studying the code skeleton file carefully.<br>def play(N=2, K=10)<br>The play() function has undergone the most significant reworking since the previous assignment. Aside<br>from an additional variable, which changes the parameters of the deck you play with, the big change is in<br>the main iteration that continues until the deck is exhausted. Previously, this loop was divided into two<br>sections: one for the human player and one for everyone else. The new structure merges these two<br>sections into a single loop and relegates the differentiation of the human player from the computer<br>player(s) to getMove(). The last change to play() involves assignment of any cards remaining on the table<br>to the last player who successfully matched, a job handled by the addition of a variable, last, that is reset<br>each time a player makes a match.<br>def getMove(i, N, H, T, P)<br>The purpose of getMove() has changed significantly from HW4. In HW4, getMove() was to return a<br>single ‘‘best’’ move for a given (automated) player, where each move consisted only of matching a single<br>card from the player’s hand with a single card from the table or the top card from an opposing player’s<br>stash. But now that we permit matching a single card from the player’s hand with the sum of multiple<br>cards from the table or from the top of each opposing player’s stash, we need to generate and then<br>consider the space of all possible legal moves. Each move is represented as (c, M), where c is the index<br>into the player’s hand correspond to the card they will play and M is a list of indeces selected from the<br>table and/or the opposing player’s stashes such that sum(M)≡ H[i][c][0]. If (c, M) is (c,[]), then the<br>move corresponds to discarding c to the table.<br>Your job is to implement helper(c,v, j, M, L) to generate all legal moves, from which one will be<br>selected and returned as the value of getMove(). Let’s examine getMove() more closely:<br>(1)  The first step is to determine if the argument i relates to the human player (i ≡0). If so, then move<br>selection is relegated to pickMove().<br>(2)  The second step invokes the as-yet-unwritten helper function helper(c,v, j, M, L) repeatedly<br>(once for each card held by the current player) to generate the list L of all legal moves.<br>(3)  The third step returns a random card to discard if no legal moves were found.<br>(4)  The final step returns the legal move that maximizes the number of cards captured by the current<br>player (note that other heuristics might be used to make a ‘‘best’’ move selection from the list L of<br>legal moves).<br>The helper() function is a recursive function that constructs the set of legal moves. If you think of the<br>len(T) cards on the table and the up to N − 1 player stashes (excluding the current player’s stash) as<br>defining a space of size 2 len(T)+N−1 , you will need to enumerate the up to this many card combinations by<br>considering possible inclusion or exclusion of each successive card. The arguments to<br>helper(c,v, j, M, L) are designed to help you do so.<br>(1)  The first argument, c, is the index of the card you are trying to match from player i’s hand.<br>(2)  The second argument, v, initially the value of c, represents how many ‘‘points’’ remain to match<br>with the addition of each successive card. When this number reaches 0, you know the cards<br>you’ve selected so far sum to the original value you were trying to match.<br>2 Revised October 24, 2016<br>(3)  The third argument, j, initially 0, is the index of the card you are currently considering adding to<br>the legal move you are construction. On each successive recursive call, you’ll increase j by 1 to<br>indicate you are going to consider the next card, from 0 through N up to N + len(T) − 1. At each<br>recursive step, you will want to explore both adding the jth card to the current legal move or not<br>adding it.<br>(4)  The fourth argument, M, initially [], is the legal move under construction. Each time you elect to<br>include an additional card, you will need to extend M to include that card’s index.<br>(5)  The last argument, L, initially [], is the list of legal moves you have found so far. Each new leg al<br>move you discover should be added to L, and the updated L should be the value returned from<br>helper().<br>def pickMove(i, N, H, T, P)<br>pickMove() is called by getMove() when the first argument i to getMove() corresponds to the human<br>player. pickMove() interacts with the user to obtain a legal move (c, M). Note that pickMove() must<br>guarantee that the move is both legal in every sense and that the cards selected from the table and the top<br>of any opposing player’s stash do, in fact, sum to the value of the card selected from the player’s hand.<br>The Ground Rules<br>Because this class is part of the NSF study we have previously described to you, the ground rules may<br>differ slightly section by section. In your section, you will start working on your assignment in discussion<br>section and continue working on it in next week’s discussion section. We ask that you upload a partial<br>solution to ICON at the end of each session (this will not be graded, it is just to see how far you get during<br>the discussion section). You will also be asked to answer a short survey about your experience after each<br>discussion section. Once you upload your final solution to ICON (when the assignment is complete),<br>your will be asked to fill out a separate short survey about your work on the assignment.<br>Just as a reminder, under no circumstances should you turn in the work of someone else (including any<br>code or material you may find on the Internet) as your own, nor should you share your own work with<br>others. It is fine, however, to discuss general concepts with your classmates as long as these discussions<br>do not lead to the actual exchange of code fragments or written solutions.<br>You hav e several sources for help. Your first recourse should always be to post your question on the ICON<br>discussion board. This is the fastest place to go for clarifications or disambiguation, or for help with<br>Python in general (remember, don’t post your solution or any part of your solution). Second, if you must<br>share a portion of your code, you can always attend a TA help session (see the announcement on ICON<br>entitled General TA Office Hours start Thursday, September 1 for times and locations). You may also<br>attend my office hours Tuesdays from 1:30 to 3:30 in my office (14 MLH). Finally, you may email your<br>code with a specific question to me or to your TA, but please be sure that you include CS1210 on the<br>subject line (also, this is the slowest way of getting help, due to the volume of mail we are likely to<br>receive).<br>What to Hand In<br>As before, for credit, you must make sure your function definitions exactly match the ‘‘signatures’’ giv en<br>in this problem specification. Your files should be uploaded to the HW5 dropbox folder in ICON by the<br>specified time and date: late assignments will not be accepted.<br>You should start building your solution file according to the template at the end of this assignment (the<br>template file, hw5.py, can be downloaded from ICON), substituting your own name for mine, obviously.<br>obviously. Note that the template file is incomplete and will not load in its present state.<br>3 Revised October 24, 2016<br>Make sure that you follow the instructions given for each function exactly, as the autograder expects these<br>functions to follow the naming convention shown. Also note the use of the comment character, #, at the<br>beginning of each line that is not intended to be interpreted by Python. You should use comments liberally<br>to explain what you are doing to the human reader.<br>4 Revised October 24, 2016<br><br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>中级难度<br><br>主要实现了细胞生成游戏。<br>需要实现游戏的逻辑代码，以及界面仿真代码。<br><br>首先：<br>完成代码的逻辑编写。比如活细胞和无细胞在不同的邻居个数的情况下，<br>下一代会是活细胞或者无细胞的判断。<br><br>其次需要实现接口函数，来显示不同的使用策略。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>The Game of Life is a well-known mathematical game that gives rise to amazingly<br>complex behavior, although it can be specified by a few simple rules. (It is not actually a<br>game in the traditional sense, with players competing for a win.) Here are the rules. The<br>game is played on a rectangular grid. Each square on the grid can be either empty<br>(represented by a 0 in our version) or occupied by a “living” cell (represented by a 1). At<br>the beginning, you can specify empty and occupied cells in some way; then the game<br>runs automatically. In each generation, the next generation is computed. A new cell is<br>born on an empty square if it is surrounded by exactly three occupied neighbor cells. A<br>cell dies of overcrowding if it is surrounded by four or more living neighbors, and it dies<br>of loneliness if it is surrounded by zero or one living neighbor. A neighbor is an occupant<br>of an adjacent square to the left, right, top, or bottom or in a diagonal direction. Figure 16<br>shows a cell and its neighbor cells.<br>Many configurations show interesting behavior when subjected to these rules. Figure 17<br>shows a glider, observed over five generations. Note how it moves. After four<br>generations, it is transformed into the identical shape, but located one square to the right<br>and below.<br>One of the more amazing configurations is the glider gun: a complex collection of cells<br>that, after 30 moves, turns back into itself and a glider (see the large figure at the end).<br>Over the next two weeks, you will use Python to program the game to eliminate the<br>drudgery of computing successive generations by hand. Your homework assignment will<br>come in two parts, also known as Programming Assignment 6 and Programming<br>Assignment 7. The Wikipedia page on The Game of Life has a lot of useful information,<br>as well as some real-time examples of program behavior. You should take a look at it.<br>Implementing this game requires a plan for what to do about the cells at the edges of the<br>grid, since those cells don’t have a full complement of eight neighbors. The Wikipedia<br>entry does bring up this issue, and options range from simple to complex. For our<br>purposes, it is sufficient to assume that every square outside of the grid is empty (i.e., 0)<br>and will remain empty for the duration of the game.<br>(Much of the description above, and all the figures below, is borrowed from a textbook<br>by Cay Horstmann.)<br>Programming Assignment 6 - Game of Life, Part 1<br>Your solution is to be written using Python 3. Make sure you provide comments<br>including the file name, your name, and the date at the top of the file you submit.<br>Also make sure to include appropriate docstrings for all functions.<br>The names of your functions must exactly match the names given in this assignment.<br>The order of the parameters in your parameter list must exactly match the order<br>given in this assignment.<br>For any given problem below, you may want to write additional functions other<br>than those specified for your solution. That’s fine with us.<br>The  core  problem  to  be  solved  in  the  implementation  of  the  Game  of  Life  is  how  to<br>generate  the  next  grid  from  the  current  grid.   Your  task  is  to  write  a  function  called<br>nextGen  which  expects  only  one  argument.   That  argument  is  a  two-­‐dimensional<br>table  (i.e.,  a  list  of  lists)  with  m  rows  and  n  columns,  representing  the  current  grid.<br>The  elements  of  the  table  are  either  0  (empty  square)  or  1  (occupied  square).   You<br>may  assume  that  all  rows  have  the  same  number  of  elements.<br>Given  the  current  grid,  nextGen  computes  and  returns  (but  does  not  print)  a  new<br>next  grid  (without  altering  the  current  grid)  by  applying  the  simple  rules  provided<br>above.   For  example,  given  this  initial  grid:<br>glider = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,1,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,1,0,0,0],<br>[0,1,1,1,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]<br>your function should work like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = nextGen(glider)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; y = nextGen(x)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; y<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; z = nextGen(y)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; z<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; q = nextGen(z)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; q<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>If we formatted those results nicely, we’d see a sequence like this:<br>## generation 1<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 2<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 3<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 4<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>These grids correspond to the generations in Figure 17. Note that the grid passed to your<br>function must remain unaltered:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; glider<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>Where to do the assignment<br>You can do this assignment on your own computer, or in the labs. In either case, use the<br>IDLE development environment – that’s what we’ll use when we grade your program.<br>Put all the functions you created in a file called “prog67.py”. Save that file until you’ve<br>completed Programming Assignment 7.<br>Submitting the Assignment<br>Do not turn in this assignment by itself. Submit it with the work you do for Programming<br>Assignment 7.<br>Saving your work<br>If you are working in the lab, you will need to copy your program to your own flash-drive<br>or save the program to your workspace on SmartSite. To save it on flash-drive, plug the<br>flash-drive into the computer (your TAs or the staff in the labs can help you figure out<br>how), open the flash-drive, and copy your work to it by moving the folder with your files<br>from the Desktop onto the flash-drive. To copy the file to your SmartSite workspace, go<br>to Workspace, select Resources, and then use the Add button next to “My Workspace”.<br>Your TAs can help you with this if you run into trouble.<br><br><br></font>

The structure of the tests<br>isn’t really as important as the testing plan, but we get to test both.<br>What to Test<br>We wanted to come up with a function for you to test that had a bit of everything: loops, selection, lists,<br>strings, dictionaries, objects, etc. But we had a bit of a conundrum. We wanted something complicated<br>enough to be interesting, but knew you were busy with your assignment, and didn’t want everyone to have<br>to spend lots of time writing a new function in order to test it.<br>That’s when it hit us. You’re already writing a function that you’ll probably want to test anyway…<br>cartesian product! It’s got everything we need, you already have to write it, and now it can help you test<br>your own code for A2. (A pretty smart move if I do say so myself).<br>How to Start<br>Before you start writing any code, you should think about coverage testing, and how we came up with a<br>test plan in lecture. Figure out all of the parameters, and the important ranges they fall into. Then write one<br>test for each possible combination of ranges. The goal here is to find one example test case for all possible<br>regions of your testing space.<br>Most of your actual tests will probably involve code that looks like this (now do you see why we made you<br>write set dict and get dict?<br>d1 = {…}<br>d2 = {…}<br>t1 = Table()<br>t2 = Table()<br>t1.set_dict(d1)<br>t2.set_dict(d2)<br>result_table = squeal.cartesian_product(t1, t2)<br>result_dict = result_table.get_dict()<br>expected_dict = {…}<br>self.assertEqual(result_dict, expected_dict)<br>What to Do<br>In a file called ex10.py, you should write a UnitTest to thoroughly test cartesian product. Your tests will<br>actually be run on a version of the code that I have written. Therefore, you will be doing black box testing<br>(you don’t know if I implemented the cartesian product or the Table class in the same way you will… in<br>fact, you can bet that I probably won’t). My cartesian product function will be in a file called squeal.py,<br>and my Table class will be in a file called database.py. Both will be placed into the same directory as your<br>UnitTest. We’ve provided you with some starter code, just to make sure you can access everything correctly.<br>What to Submit<br>Submit your ex10.py file to MarkUs as usual. Your UnitTest methods do not need any DocStrings, and<br>unless you’re doing something particularly unusual, you probably don’t need any internal comments either.<br>However, your method names and error messages should be descriptive enough to properly explain what<br>each test case does and why it’s useful. Remember that writing frivolous test cases is no better than missing<br>useful ones.<br>1<br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>低级难度<br><br>主要实现了利用三种方式来生成密码。<br>方法一： 随机法，前三位从A-Z生成，后三位从0-9生成。<br>方法二：右旋法，即参照ACSII码表来生成，比如A转换成D.<br>方法三：藏尾法，即输入一句话，从句子中的每一个单词的最后一位组成密码。<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br><br>Write a Python program that generates passwords in three different ways.<br>a)Generate a random 6 character password. The first 3 characters must be capital letters (A – Z) and the second 3 characters must be numeric characters (0 – 9).<br><br>b)Enter a secret word and then specify an amount of ‘right shift’ of the characters to encrypt your word. This simple method to encrypt data is attributed to Julius Caesar, the Roman Emperor. (If you are interested, you may like to read the following… <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank" rel="external">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher</a>). This method takes each character in a message and replaces it with one which is a certain distance (offset) along the alphabet from it (moving right). For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . . . . . A B C D E F G H I J K L M . . . +3 A B C D E F G H I J . . . If the offset is 3 then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F etc. In this case the word DIG encrypts to GLJ. In order to decrypt the word/string, simply offset by the same amount moving in the opposite direction (i.e. moving left). Instead of restricting the cipher to the alphabetic characters only, we will use all of the printable ASCII characters. That is, all the characters from ASCII 32 (Space) to ASCII 126 (~).<br><br> You will need to use the following two functions - ord(c) Given c, a string of length one ord(c), returns an integer representing the value of the string. For example: ord(‘a’) returns the integer 97. chr(i) Returns a string of one character whose ASCII code is the integer i. For example: chr(97) returns the string ‘a’.<br>c)Enter a secret sentence and create a password by taking the last letter of each word.<br><br>Write a menu driven program called yourId_encryptor.py that will allow the user to enter commands and process these commands until the quit command is entered.<br><br><br><br></font>
