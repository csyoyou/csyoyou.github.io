Heavy penalties will<br>apply for late submission. This is an individual assignment and must be entirely your own work. You must<br>attribute the source of any part of your code which you have not written yourself. Please note the section on<br>plagiarism in this document.<br>The assignment must be done using the BlueJ environment. All user input to the system, and system<br>output to the user, must be done at the BlueJ terminal window. No other graphical interfaces are to be<br>used (nor assessed) in your program.<br>The Java source code for this assignment must be implemented according to the FIT9131 Java Coding<br>Standards.<br>Any points needing clarification should be discussed with your tutor in the tutorial class. You should not<br>make any assumptions about the program without consulting with your tutor.<br>Specification<br>For this assignment you are required to write a program that implements a simple Student Management<br>System for a very small, fictional, school. This section specifies the required functionality of the program.<br>The aim of the Student Management System is for a user (the school’s enrolment staff) to keep a database of<br>the students enrolled in various subjects in this fictional school. This school only offers three (3) subjects :<br>Computing, Maths, and English. The system will allow the user to add/delete students, enrol them in<br>subjects, and perform simple reports.<br>Even though this program is functionally very different from the program you wrote in Assignment 1, you<br>should be able to re-use much of your previous code here - if you have designed the classes/logic in your<br>previous program properly. This is one of the major benefits of an object-oriented program - the ability to<br>re-use classes.<br>The Student Management System should provide the following features :<br> maintains a list (using a Java Collection class) of Student objects<br>o each Student object represents a person who is allowed to enrol in the fictional school<br> maintains a fixed list of exactly 3 Subject objects<br>o each Subject object represents a subject which is available in the fictional school<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 2<br> enrol each student in a subject, or subjects (HD level)<br> lists the details of an existing student<br> produces a report of students based on some criteria<br> loads a list of students (with their enrolled subjects) from a text file<br> saves the list of current students (with their enrolled subjects) to a text file<br>You are to demonstrate the following programming techniques in your program :<br> reading/writing data from/to text files<br> using appropriate Java Collection class or classes to store data<br> using code to manipulate the data in the collection(s)<br> performing simple searches, filtered by some given criteria<br> using program constructs such as repetitions &amp; selections<br> using appropriate classes to represent objects in the program<br>There will be a description of the “HD level” features later in this document (in the Grades section).<br>You are also required to produce a partial Test Strategy for your program.<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 3<br>Program Logic<br>When the Student Management System starts, it should automatically load a text file called<br>“students.txt” which contains details of all students currently stored in the system. The actual format<br>of this text file is described later in this document. The data loaded should be stored in some appropriate data<br>structures. No other reading from or writing to file is required while the program is in operation, until the<br>user chooses to exit, at which point the program saves all the data in memory back to the same text file<br>(students.txt).<br>In other words, the file I/O operations are performed automatically by the program, and require no<br>interactions with the user.<br>When the program is running, it should repeatedly display a menu with these options :<br>(1) Add new student<br>(2) Delete a student<br>(3) Find Student By Name<br>(4) List Students By Subject<br>(5) List All Students<br>(6) Exit System<br>Option (1) allows the user to add a new student into the database. The user should be asked for the student’s<br>details, plus what subject to “enrol” him/her in.<br>Option (2) allows the user to remove an existing student from the database.<br>Option (3) allows the user to find an existing student in the database. The user should be asked to enter a<br>name to search for. If a matching student is found, his/her details will be displayed.<br>Option (4) allows the user to display a list of students enrolled in a subject. The user should be asked for a<br>subject name; a list of all students (if any) enrolled in that subject should then be displayed.<br>Option (5) allows the user to display a list of all students enrolled in the school.<br>Option (6) exits the program. All the students currently in memory are automatically saved to<br>“students.txt”.<br>Inputs other than 1-6 should be rejected, and an error message printed. The menu should be displayed<br>repeatedly, until the user chooses Option (6).<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 4<br>Important Assumptions<br>You should observe the following assumptions when implementing your program :<br> all student names are unique - if a student is already in the database, trying to add the same name<br>again should generate an error<br> there is no limit to how many students can be enrolled<br> exactly 3 subjects are offered : Computing, Maths and English<br> each student can only enrol in exactly one subject<br> all searches use exact matches (eg. “andy” will not match “andy cheng”); however, the search<br>strings are not case-sensitive (eg. “Sue Smith” is considered to be the same as “SUE smith”)<br> the data file is always in the correct format - ie. no need to validate the data when reading it in<br>Student Record Format<br>Each student in the database contains the following information :<br> Name (non-blank String, may contain multiple words)<br> Telephone (non-blank String, exactly 9 digits, 1st digit must be a ‘9’)<br> Subject (a String, representing one of the 3 subjects offered)<br>Input File Format<br>The input data file (students.txt) has the following format for each line :<br>Name,Telephone,Subject  (the fields are separated by commas)<br>Eg.<br>David Smith,912345678,Maths<br>Andy Cheng,987654321,Computing<br>Susan Dally,911221122,English<br>Zak Whatever,999999999,Maths<br>Russell Crowe,980808080,Computing<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 5<br>Program Design<br>Your program must demonstrate your understanding of the object-oriented concepts and general<br>programming constructs presented in FIT9131. You must use appropriate data structures to store the various<br>objects (list of students, list of subjects, etc) in the program.<br>You must be able to justify the choice of the data structures during your interview. You must document any<br>additional assumptions you made.<br>Validation of values for fields and local variables should also be implemented. You should not allow an<br>object of a class to be set to an invalid state.<br>Discuss with your tutor regarding what classes are appropriate, and how they interact with each other.<br>The main requirements are : (1) the Students and Subjects must be implemented as objects, and they must<br>be stored in some appropriate Java collections, and (2) for the HD level , the list of Subjects within each<br>Student object must also be stored in some appropriate Java collections.<br>Your program must deal with invalid values entered by the user in a sensible manner. For instance, if a user<br>enters “abc” instead of a number for the menu options, your program should not crash.<br>All on-screen input/output should be formatted in a user-friendly manner. Sensible error messages should be<br>displayed whenever appropriate (eg. when searching for a student who is not in the database, trying to enrol<br>student in a subject which does not exist, etc).<br>Grades<br>There are 2 possible Grade Categories for this assignment, as described below :<br>1) A maximum grade of up to a D (Distinction) can be achieved by correctly implementing all the<br>features as described in the “Program Logic” section above.<br>2) To achieve up to a maximum of a HD (High Distinction), you need to implement the following<br>additional features :<br> for Option (1), a student can be enrolled in up to a maximum of 3 unique subjects<br> for Option (4), the user can specify more than 1 subject, and the program will display all<br>students listed in those subjects (eg. all students enrolled in both “Computing” AND “English”,<br>all students enrolled in “Computing” AND “Maths” AND “English”, etc)<br>Note : The description of the program’s logic/design is intentionally left vague, to give you some room<br>to exercise your own design and creativity. Discuss with your tutor about what/how to implement.<br>Important : You must not attempt the HD Category until you have fully implemented the D<br>Category. If you submit a program which partially implements both, you will only be awarded up<br>to a maximum of D.<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 6<br>Test Strategy<br>For this assignment, you are required to produce a partial Test Strategy for the program.<br>There is no need to produce Test Strategy for any other classes you have used in your program.<br>You must provide a Test Plan, plus detailed sets of Test Data, Expected Results and Actual Results for the<br>Student class.<br>Assessment<br>Assessment for this assignment will be done via an interview with your tutor. The marks will be allocated as<br>follows:<br> Test Strategy : 10%<br> Java Code &amp; Object-Oriented Design : 35%<br> Program Functionality in accordance with the requirements : 55%<br>You must submit your work by the submission deadline on the due date (a late penalty of 20% per day of<br>the possible marks will apply).<br>Marks will be deducted for untidy submissions and non-conformances to the FIT9131 Java Coding<br>Standards.<br>Interview<br>You will be asked to demonstrate your program at an interview following the submission date. At the<br>interview you can also expect to be asked to explain your code, your design, discuss design decisions and<br>alternatives and modify your code as required. Marks will not be awarded for any section of code or<br>functionality that a student cannot explain satisfactorily. (The marker may delete excessive comments in<br>code before a student is asked to explain that code).<br>In other words, you will be assessed on your understanding of the code, and not on the actual code itself.<br>Interview times will be arranged in the tutorial labs in Week 12. It is your responsibility to attend the lab and<br>arrange an interview time with your tutor. Any student who does not attend an interview will receive a mark<br>of 0 for the assignment.<br>The actual interviews will take place in Week 13.<br>Your Test Strategy will be only for one class - the Student class.<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 7<br>Submission Requirements<br>The assignment must be uploaded to Moodle on or before the due date. The link to upload the assignment<br>will be made available in the Assignments section of the unit’s Moodle site before the submission deadline.<br>The submission requirements are as follows:<br>A .zip file uploaded to Moodle containing the following components:<br> the BlueJ project you created to implement your assignment. The .zip should be named with your<br>Student ID Number. For example, if your id is 12345678, then the file should be named<br>12345678_A2.zip. Do not name your file any other way.<br> it is your responsibility to check that your ZIP file contains all the correct files, and is not corrupted,<br>before you submit it. If you tutor cannot open your zip file, or if it does not contain the correct files,<br>you will not be assessed.<br> an MS Word document containing your Test Strategy for the Student class.  (Note: The JUnit facility in<br>BlueJ is NOT to be used for this assignment)<br> a completed Assignment Cover Sheet. This will be available for download from the unit’s Moodle site<br>before the submission deadline. You simply complete the editable sections of the document, save it, and<br>include it in your .zip file for submission.<br>Marks will be deducted for failure to comply with any of these requirements.<br>Warning : there will be no extensions to the due date. Any late submission will incur the 20% per day<br>penalty. It is strongly suggested that you submit the assignment well before the deadline, in case there are<br>some unexpected complications on the day (eg. interruptions to your home internet connection).<br>Plagiarism<br>Cheating and plagiarism are viewed as serious offences. In cases where cheating has been confirmed,<br>students have been severely penalised, from losing all marks for an assignment, to facing disciplinary action<br>at the Faculty level. Monash has several policies in relation to these offences and it is your responsibility to<br>acquaint yourself with these.<br>Plagiarism (<a href="http://www.policy.monash.edu/policybank/academic/education/conduct/plagiarism-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.policy.monash.edu/policybank/academic/education/conduct/plagiarism-policy.html</a>)<br>Discipline: Student Policy (<a href="http://www.policy.monash.edu/policy-" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.policy.monash.edu/policy-</a><br>bank/academic/education/conduct/student-discipline-policy.html<br><br><br></font>
