Test your knowledge of basic Java concepts;<br>2.  Evaluate your ability to design programming logic;<br>3. Practise your knowledge of class design and OO constructs in Java;<br>4. Practise error handling in Java;<br>5. Develop a reasonable sized application in Java.<br>This is an individual assignment and worth 15% towards your final grade..<br>Academic Integrity (more)<br>The submitted assignment must be your own work. No marks will be awarded for any parts<br>which are not created by you.<br>Plagiarism is treated very seriously at RMIT. Plagiarism includes copying code directly from<br>other students, internet or other resources without proper reference. Sometimes, students<br>study and work on assignments together and submit similar files: this may be regarded as<br>plagiarism.<br>Please note that you should always create your own assignment even if you have very similar<br>ideas. Plagiarism-detection tools will be used for all submissions. Severe penalties may be<br>applied in cases of plagiarism, including loss of all marks or, in repeat cases, expulsion from<br>the course.<br>At any point, but especially during the scheduled lab-demonstrations, you may be required to<br>show and explain your design and code to any of the teaching staff.<br>General Implementation Details<br> All input data should be read from the standard input and all output data should be<br>printed to the standard output. There is no need to use files all.<br> If the input is formatted incorrectly the execution should stop immediately and an<br>appropriate error message should be displayed.<br> Marks will be allocated to your class design. You are required to modularise classes<br>properly—i.e., to use multiple methods as appropriate. No method should be longer<br>than 50 lines.<br> Marks will be allocated to proper documentation and coding layout and style. Your<br>coding style should be consistent with standard Java coding conventions<br>(<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html</a>)<br> Your programs will be marked on RMIT UNIX machines using Java SE 7.0. Make<br>sure you test your program on these machines before you submit.<br> Further hints, tips and details, including submission instructions, will be made via<br>Blackboard and in lectures.<br>Overall Specification<br>You will implement an electronic ticket for public transport, called MyTi (My Ticket).<br> A MyTi can be “charged” by adding credit to it: initially, a MyTi has zero credit; a MyTi<br>can hold up to $100 of credit.<br> Any attempt to add credit that goes above the limit causes an error message and for the<br>charge to fail.<br> Amounts to be credited to a MyTi must be integer dollar amounts in precise multiples of<br>$5.00.<br> Travel Passes can be bought using a MyTi ticket: a pass can be for either “2 Hours” or<br>“All Day”, and can be for either “Zone 1” or “Zone 1 and 2”.<br> Prices are as follows:<br>o 2 Hour Zone 1 pass: $3.50<br>o 2 Hour Zone 1+2 pass: $5.00<br>o All Day Zone 1 pass: $6.90<br>o All Day Zone 1+2 pass: $9.80<br> If you attempt to purchase a travel pass without sufficient credit on your MyTi ticket then<br>the attempt fails: no ticket is issued and there is no charge to your ticket.<br>Your system must handle multiple MyTi tickets, each with its own unique id—the id will be<br>used to identify which MyTi ticket is being used / charged / etc.<br>Journeys and Travel Passes<br>The MyTi system is designed to automatically combine multiple Journeys in a day by one<br>User into the cheapest Travel Pass that covers those Journeys. For example, if a User travels<br>twice inside 2 hours, then a 2 Hour pass is purchased. However, if the user travels again later<br>in the day, the 2 Hour pass may be turned into an All Day pass if that is cheaper than 2 2-<br>Hour passes.<br>Each time the user asks for a new Journey, the previously purchased Travel Pass should be<br>checked:<br>1. If the current Travel Pass is an All Day and we are in the day and the pass covers the<br>journey zones, then a new Travel Pass does not need to be purchased;<br>2. If the new Journey fits inside the 2 Hours of the current Travel Pass, then a new<br>Travel Pass does not need to be purchased;<br>3. If the current Travel Pass is a 2 Hour and the new Journey is outside that time, then a<br>new 2 Hour Pass needs to be purchased.<br>TravelPass objects should store the information needed for all decisions described above<br>(e.g. whether to add a new Journey into an existing TravelPass).<br>To purchase a Travel Pass take a Journey, the system user must be prompted for:<br>-  The id of the MyTi card is to be charged to be used;<br>-  the day of travel, the start time and the end time;<br>-  the starting Station and end Station of the journey.<br>BONUS: The above means that users may spend more on Travel Passes than they needed to:<br>e.g., they may end up buying multiple 2-hour travel passes instead of one All Day pass. A<br>bonus task is implement logic that always results in the cheapest Travel Pass options:<br>1. IF the new Travel Pass means that all that day’s Passes would add up to cost more<br>than a All Day Pass—then all the Passes for that day are replaced by a single All Day<br>Pass; in this case the MyTi card is charged the difference between what has already<br>been paid that day, and what an All Day Pass would cost.<br>2. You have to do similar thinking about when different Journeys are in different Zones!<br>I’ll leave that to you to think about <br>If you try to purchase a Journey that requires a new Travel Pass, or an upgrade from 2 Hour<br>to All Day, and there is not enough credit left on their MyTi card, then the purchase of that<br>Journey must fail (with an Exception), and the user told they need to recharge their card.<br>Users<br>A MyTi ticket can be associated with one unique User. The MyTi ticket needs to store details<br>of its user, such as name and email address. A User needs to have access to their MyTi card.<br>Day and Times<br>To make things easier (and to run demos in less than real time!) you will type in the day and<br>times of Journeys (rather than using a System call to get them automatically). Using a “24<br>hour” time representation should make it easy to determine the length of Journeys. Note that<br>a Journey fits inside a 2 Hour pass if it ends before the end of the 2 Hour period. An All Day<br>pass covers all journeys that start inside that day and runs from midnight to 23:59pm.<br>Stations<br>Stations have a unique name and each Station can tell which Zone it is in.<br>Admin Functions<br>You also need to implement the following system administration functions:<br>-  On request, print all TravelPasses purchased on all MyTi cards. This list should<br>ordered by card id. For each TravelPass, list the Journeys that were in it;<br>-  Print usage statistics for all Stations: i.e., how many journeys started at each Station,<br>how many finished at each Station;<br>-  Create a new User: this requires input of a new id (the operation fails if it is already in<br>use), name, type (Adult, Junior, Senior), and email address.<br>Program Development<br>When implementing large programs, especially using object-oriented style, it is highly<br>recommended that you build your program incrementally.<br>This assignment proposes a specific incremental implementation process: this is designed to<br>both help you think about building large programs, and to help ensure good progress! You are<br>not strictly required to follow the structure below, but it will help you manage complexity.<br>Part A (1 mark): Extend existing code<br>Sample code implementing the outline of menu-based main program will be made available.<br>1. Design the TravelPass class to contain all data and operations it needs (e.g. the Zone<br>and Duration; Day and Start/End times);<br>2. Define Exceptions to handle problems/errors. These may include: trying to<br>purchase a pass without having enough funds; recharging by an invalid amount;<br>invalid menu options or inputs, etc.<br>Part B (1 mark): Class Design<br>Define all the classes and interfaces needed for the described system. In particular, you<br>should try to encapsulate all the appropriate data and operations that a class needs. This may<br>mean some classes refer to each other (e.g., the way Account refers to Customer).<br>At this point, you may just want to think about the data and operations and just write the<br>definitions, not all the code.<br>You will be submitting or demonstrating your class design in tutes or labs before the<br>due date. Details will be announced in lectures and on Blackboard.<br>Part C (3 marks): Main Program<br>Your main program should be in a class called MyTiSystem. (Of course, any class can<br>contain a main(); this is useful for testing that class.) The main program contains a menu that<br>offers the following options in a loop:<br>1. Buy a Travel Pass using a MyTi card<br>2. Recharge a MyTi card<br>3. Show remaining credit for a MyTi card<br>4. Purchase a Journey using a MyTi card<br>5. Print all Journeys made using all MyTi cards<br>6. Show Station statistics<br>7. Add a new User<br>8. Quit<br>Since we managing multiple MyTi cards, we have to enter a card’s id to know which MyTi<br>ticket to charge for a travel pass.<br>Part D (4 marks): Implement Core Functionality<br>Implement the core functionality of the MyTi system described above, except for the<br>complex decision-making around deciding whether a journey fits inside an existing<br>Travel Pass—i.e. in this version, just have the system buy a 2 Hour Travel Pass for each<br>Journey. You should be able to implement the rest of the MyTi functionality described above,<br>and run and test your system<br>Part E (1 marks): Include Multiple Journeys in Travel Passes<br>Implement the logic that decides whether a new Journey fits inside an existing Travel Pass or<br>whether the user needs to buy a new Travel Pass for that Journey.<br>Demos (1 mark each – 2 marks total)<br>You are required to demonstrate your progress and final solution to the teaching staff twice.<br>Details will be made available during lectures and on Blackboard.<br>Other (3 marks)<br>Marks will be awarded for coding style, documentation/comments, code layout and clarity,<br>meaningful error and other messages, proper error handling, choice of data structures and<br>other design decisions. You are encouraged to discuss such issues with your tutors and lab<br>assistants, or with the coding mentors.<br>Bonus (1.5 marks each)<br> Implement logic, or “business rules”, for combining Travel Passes so that the user is<br>charged the cheapest Travel Pass that fits their day of travel. You are welcome to discuss<br>the logic and different conditions via Blackboard Discussion boards; however, every<br>student must implement the final Java solution by themselves.<br> There will be another bonus task announced later on for students that would like to<br>challenge themselves further.<br>Test Data<br>Your program MUST include the following test items: just create them in your main program<br>and use them to populate your data structures that keep track of all such items. These will be<br>used to test/mark your program so it’s crucial that you enter them. You may add further Users<br>and Stations if you wish, but you must add at least the ones below.<br> Users (id, type, name, email)<br>o lc, Lawrence Cavedon, lawrence.cavedon@rmit.edu.au<br> Stations (name, zone)<br>o Central, 1<br>o Flagstaff, 1<br>o Richmond, 1<br>o Lilydale, 2<br>o Epping, 2<br>Sample Test Runs<br>Sample runs demonstrating behaviour of the system will be provided on Blackboard.<br>Submission<br>Assignment submission will be via Blackboard, by 5.00pm, Monday September 12 2016.<br>You can submit your assignment as many times as you want before the due date. Each<br>submission will overwrite any previous submissions.<br>1. You need to submit a class diagram (in pdf, gif or jpeg format).<br>2. You are required to submit your .java files weekly via Blackboard. Your progress will<br>be taken into consideration in marking. Further details will follow.<br>3. You must include a README file. This should describe how to run your program,<br>what extra functionality you implemented, any standard functionality you know does<br>not work, and any problems or assumptions. If the tutors have any problem running<br>your program and the README does not help then you will lose marks.<br>4. There will also be demos for this assignment. You will be asked to demonstrate your<br>progress and/or explain your design. Details of the demo will be announced on<br>Blackboard and in lectures.<br>5. For the code submission, you must include only the source files in your submission<br>(do not submit any *.class files!). Your code must on under RMIT UNIX machines.<br>6. Late final submissions will incur a penalty of 10% per day. Submissions made 5 days<br>after the due date will receive no marks.<br><br><br></font>
