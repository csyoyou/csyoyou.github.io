The goal is<br>to build a hand of cards that values as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. First,<br>here is the terminology used in the game.<br> Hit: Take another card for your hand<br> Stand: Stop taking cards<br> Bust: Exceed a value of 21 in your hand<br> Push: Tie with the dealer<br>The cards are valued as follows.<br>Rank Value<br>Ace 11 or 1<br>2–10 Face value<br>Jack, Queen, King 10<br>Of particular note, an Ace can be considered either value 11 or 1. Given rational strategy,<br>it will be considered 11 unless that will cause a bust, in which case it will be considered 1.<br>In each hand, play proceeds as follows.<br>1. The dealer takes one card, which the player can see.<br>2. The player is given two cards.<br>3. The player has the option to hit, or take one additional card. The player can hit as<br>many times as desired, until they reach or exceed 21, or decide to stand (stop taking<br>cards).<br>1<br>4. If the player did not bust (exceed 21), the dealer takes cards until she reaches 17 or<br>higher (i.e., the dealer will hit on 16 or fewer points, and stand on 17 or more points).<br>5. If the player busts, she immediately loses, and the dealer will not draw more cards.<br>If the dealer busts, the player wins. If the player and dealer have the same total, it is<br>a push. Otherwise, the winner is the one with higher point total.<br>6. If the player loses, she loses her bet. If the player wins, she wins her bet. If the hand<br>is a push, the bet is returned (i.e., no gain or loss).<br>In this project, you will program a functional Blackjack game by first coding the basic logic<br>of the game, then gradually adding features.<br>2<br>Lab Session 1, Feb 24–Feb 25<br>Activity 1<br>In this activity, you will code the logic of the game using simplifications, rather than tackling<br>a full Blackjack game all at once. Instead of selecting a card and then determining its value,<br>you will instead randomly generate a card’s value from between 2 and 11. You will also<br>assume that the bet is always $25.<br>Note that randomly generating a card’s value is not an accurate way to simulate draws. In a<br>real deck, there are more cards worth 10 than there are, e.g., cards worth 5. Consider other<br>ways in which this version of Blackjack will not be exactly the same as real-life Blackjack.<br>You will add features to make the game more realistic in later activities.<br>1. Write a main() function that asks the user for their name, and initializes their starting<br>money to $1,000.<br>2. Write a loop in main() that will play a hand of blackjack, then ask the user if they want<br>to play another hand (as long as they still have money to bet). You will play a hand<br>by calling the play_hand(name) function (which does not yet exist). This function<br>should return the change in the player’s money (positive if they win, negative if they<br>lose), and you should use this value to update their amount after each hand.<br>3. Write the play_hand(name) function. In this function, you will need to track the<br>running total of the cards that the dealer and player have been dealt. Deal one card<br>to the dealer and two to the player. Prompt the player for their action (hit/stay)<br>until they reach or exceed 21, or choose to stay. Then, deal cards to the dealer until<br>they reach or exceed 17. Determine the winner, and return the change in the player’s<br>money (i.e., 25 if they won, -25 if they lost, and 0 if the hand was a push).<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Dealer received card of value 2<br>Bill received card of value 9<br>Bill received card of value 5<br>Dealer total: 2<br>Bill total: 14<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received card of value 6<br>Dealer total: 2<br>3<br>Bill total: 20<br>Move? (hit/stay) s<br>Dealer received card of value 4<br>Dealer total: 6<br>Bill total: 20<br>Dealer received card of value 5<br>Dealer total: 11<br>Bill total: 20<br>Dealer received card of value 10<br>Dealer total: 21<br>Bill total: 20<br>Dealer wins<br>Bill has $975<br>Play again?

(y/n) y<br>Dealer received card of value 3<br>Bill received card of value 11<br>Bill received card of value 10<br>Dealer total: 3<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer received card of value 7<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer received card of value 3<br>Dealer total: 13<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer received card of value 11<br>Dealer total: 24<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer bust<br>Bill has $1,025<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>5<br>Activity 2<br>In this activity, you will improve the drawing of cards. You will use the strategy we’ve<br>learned in lecture for encoding information in a way that the computer can store it: trans-<br>form the information into a number. In this activity, use an integer to store each card, and<br>represent them as follows.<br>Rank int encoding Point value<br>Ace (A) 1 11<br>2 2 2<br>3 3 3<br>4 4 4<br>5 5 5<br>6 6 6<br>7 7 7<br>8 8 8<br>9 9 9<br>10 10 10<br>Jack (J) 11 10<br>Queen (Q) 12 10<br>King (K) 13 10<br>Now, you can randomly generate a card from Ace to King, rather than randomly generating<br>a value. You will modify your program so that you can determine how to display each card,<br>as well as what value it has.<br>1. Write a function value_of_card(card) that takes as a parameter an int-encoded<br>card as described above (i.e., an int value from 1 to 13) and returns its point value as<br>described above.<br>2. Write a function string_of_card(card) that takes as a parameter an int-encoded<br>card as described above and returns the card’s string value for printing during the<br>game.<br>For example, string_of_card(5) should return “5”, and string_of_card(12) (a<br>Queen) should return “Q”.<br>3. Modify the play_hand function to generate a random card, rather than a random card<br>value. When adding a card to the player or dealer’s total, use value_of_card(card),<br>and when displaying a card, use string_of_card(card).<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>6<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Dealer received 2<br>Bill received A<br>Bill received K<br>Dealer total: 2<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer received A<br>Dealer total: 13<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer received 9<br>Dealer total: 22<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer bust<br>Bill has $1,025<br>Play again? (y/n) y<br>Dealer received K<br>Bill received 6<br>Bill received Q<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 16<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received 6<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 22<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>7<br>Lab Session 2, Mar 2–Mar 3<br>Activity 3<br>In this activity, you will save the player’s game and allow them to resume. You will use file<br>I/O as discussed in lecture. You will save and restore the player’s name and money total.<br>1. Write a function save(name, money) that saves the user’s name and money to the<br>file blackjack.save.<br>Hint: In order to restore this information successfully, you should save these two<br>pieces of information on separate lines of the file.<br>2. Write a function restore() that attempts to read the user’s name and money from<br>the file blackjack.save. If it is successful, it should return these values as a string and<br>an int, respectively. If it fails, it should return ‘’, -1 to indicate it was unsuccessful.<br>3. Modify function main() to call save(name, money) before quitting.<br>4. Modify function main() to call restore() when starting up. If the load was successful,<br>ask the user if they would like to resume or start a new game. If it was unsuccessful,<br>simply start a new game.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage (nothing has changed yet, because there<br>is no saved game to load):<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Dealer received K<br>Bill received Q<br>Bill received 3<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 13<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received 4<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 17<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received A<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 28<br>Bill bust<br>8<br>Bill has $975<br>Play again? (y/n) y<br>Dealer received Q<br>Bill received J<br>Bill received 6<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 16<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received J<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 26<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $950<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Here is an example of the load functionality when running the program again:<br>Resume saved game ‘Bill’? (y/n) y<br>Bill has $950<br>Dealer received K<br>Bill received 7<br>Bill received Q<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 17<br>Move? (hit/stay) s<br>Dealer received K<br>Dealer total: 20<br>Bill total: 17<br>Dealer wins<br>Bill has $925<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Finally, here is an example of starting a new game even though a saved game exists:<br>9<br>Resume saved game ‘Bill’? (y/n) n<br>Name? Phil<br>Phil has $1,000<br>Dealer received 4<br>Phil received 3<br>Phil received J<br>Dealer total: 4<br>Phil total: 13<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Phil received 10<br>Dealer total: 4<br>Phil total: 23<br>Phil bust<br>Phil has $975<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>10<br>Activity 4<br>In this activity, you will allow the player to change their bet before each hand.<br>1. Write a function input_bet(bet, money) that accepts parameter for the current bet<br>and amount of money available, and returns the bet input from the user. Perform<br>input validation on the following requirements:<br>The bet must be a whole number, cannot be negative, and cannot be greater than the<br>available money. If the user presses enter without typing anything, use the existing<br>bet value (if valid). The user can bet 0, which means they want to quit the game.<br>2. Modify main() to call input_bet(bet, money) before every hand instead of prompt-<br>ing for y/n for another hand. If the user bets 0, save their game and quit.<br>Now, you will need to pass the current bet to the play_hand function, and modify<br>this function so it returns the correct change in the player’s money when they win or<br>lose.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 1500<br>Cannot bet more than $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) Fifty<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 500<br>Dealer received J<br>Bill received 10<br>Bill received 10<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 20<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received Q<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 30<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $500<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $500)<br>Dealer received A<br>Bill received 5<br>Bill received K<br>11<br>Dealer total: 11<br>Bill total: 15<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received A<br>Dealer total: 11<br>Bill total: 26<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $0<br>Game over<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>12<br>Lab Session 3, Mar 16–Mar 17<br>Activity 5<br>In this activity, you will improve the card drawing functionality even further. In real life,<br>you cannot draw 5 Aces in a single hand. However, if we’re only generating random cards,<br>this is possible. Therefore, for each hand, you will create a deck of cards, shuffle it, and<br>draw from it.<br>1. Write a function new_deck() that returns a list containing 4 Kings, 4 Queens, etc.<br>using the integer encoding from Activity 2.<br>Hint: Use nested loops.<br>2. Write a function shuffle_deck(deck) that returns a shuffled version of the deck.<br>Hint: Use the random module.<br>3. Modify play_hand() so that it creates and shuffles a deck at the start of each hand.<br>Instead of randomly generating cards, “draw” them from the shuffled deck. Be sure<br>that you do not draw the same card from the deck multiple times (e.g., by removing<br>the card you draw from the deck).<br>Unless you know how to count cards, the output after this activity will not look very<br>different. However, your distribution of cards will be more realistic. You should run your<br>program to ensure that you are still getting random-looking cards, and not drawing the<br>same cards over and over again.<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>13<br>Activity 6<br>In this activity, you will modify your encoding of cards so that it stores both the rank (A–K)<br>and the suit (♣, ♦, ♥, ♠).<br>1. Modify new_deck() so that it creates a list of cards where each card is a tuple of size<br>2. Store the int value first, then a string value representing the suit.<br>Hint: You may be able to copy and paste the suit symbols directly into your text<br>editor. If not, you can use the following escape sequences to include the suit symbols<br>in a string literal in Python.<br>Suit Escape sequence<br>♣ \u2663<br>♦ \u2662<br>♥ \u2661<br>♠ \u2660<br>2. Modify value_of_card to account for the change in encoding of cards.<br>3. Modify the string_of_card to print both the rank and suit of the card.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 100<br>Dealer received 10♦<br>Bill received 6♦<br>Bill received 2♠<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 8<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received A♠<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 19<br>Move? (hit/stay) s<br>Dealer received A♣<br>Dealer total: 21<br>Bill total: 19<br>Dealer wins<br>14<br>Bill has $900<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $100) 0<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>15<br>Lab Session 4, Mar 23–Mar 24<br>Activity 7<br>In this activity, you will modify your program to improve its output. Instead of keeping<br>track of only the total points of the player and dealer, you will keep track of their full hand<br>as a list of cards.<br>1. Write function string_of_hand(hand) that uses the string_of_card(card) func-<br>tion to return a string of an entire hand (encoded as a list of cards).<br>2. Write function value_of_hand(hand) that uses the value_of_card(card) function<br>to return the value of an entire hand of cards.<br>3. Modify the function play_hand so that it keeps track of the hands of the player and<br>dealer, rather than just the total points for their hand. Then modify your output so<br>that it prints the hands instead of individual cards.<br>4. Modify your function value_of_hand(hand) so that it correctly adds the value of<br>Ace.<br>Recall the rule: if an Ace of value 11 would make the hand bust, it is considered to<br>be value 1 instead. Thus, an Ace alone is worth 11, an Ace and a King is worth 21,<br>and two Aces is worth 12.<br>Hint: It may help to create a list of values for each card. For example, if the user<br>has two Aces, first create the list of values [11, 11], then modify it according to the<br>rule.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name?

Completing it will result in up to 8 bonus project<br>points. In this activity, you will output the money the user has after each hand, in order<br>to graph the result using a spreadsheet program.<br>A csv file, or comma-separated values, is a set of rows where each field is separated by a<br>comma. In this bonus activity, after each hand, output the hand number and total money<br>the user has, to a row in the file blackjack.csv. The data, including the hand number,<br>should continue to accumulate even if the user has saved and resumed their game.<br>An example of such an output might be:<br>1,975<br>2,950<br>3,975<br>4,1000<br>5,1025<br>6,1050<br>7,1025<br>…<br>Once you accomplish this, play at least 20 hands, then open your blackjack.csv file in<br>a spreadsheet program such as Excel or Google Sheets. Draw a line graph showing the<br>amount of money you had over those hands.<br>Submission<br>Submit your .py file as described at <a href="https://cs.pitt.edu/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://cs.pitt.edu/</a> ~ bill/8/#submission.<br>In addition, please include a plain text file entitled README.txt that answers the following<br>questions.<br>1. Which features of your program are working properly, and which are not?<br>2. What was the hardest part about this project? How did you overcome it?<br>3. What feature do you wish you could have added to this project?<br>If you complete the Bonus Activity, submit an image file of your graph, as well.<br>21<br><br><br><br><br></font>
