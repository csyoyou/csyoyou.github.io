How can you do your assignment when half of it is gibberish!? You didn’t ask for a task<br>descryption! As you are thinking this, something suddenly occurs to you. You are a Java programmer now!<br>You have all the skills you need to crack this silly cipher, and you’re going to do it!<br>Before You Begin<br>Remember that this task is here to help you improve your programming skills. When doing this task, you<br>might find some parts tricky, but this is normal and also a good thing (if we were never challenged, we would<br>never learn anything!). The most important things are to start this task as soon as you can, to ask questions<br>when you need help and to be persistent! It’s often good to work on one part of the assignment at a time, then<br>submit to PASTA to see how you went with it. Try to be creative when approaching problems - usually there<br>are many ways to do something. We hope you enjoy this cryptography-themed task! :)<br>Part 1 – Your Own Secret Messages<br>In the first part of this assignment, your task is to write a program to encrypt and decrypt your very own secret<br>messages using a substitution cipher! This substitution cipher will involve swapping each letter of the alphabet<br>with a different letter and sometimes also removing spaces. For example, maybe “a” might be replaced with<br>“e”, “b” might be replaced with “a”, “c” might be replaced with “f” and so on.<br>In order to encrypt and decrypt these kinds of messages, the sender and receiver must both know a secret key.<br>A key is a set of rules that tell you which letters to swap with which. One way that you can represent this key<br>is with a string that contains all of the letters from a to z exactly once. The first letter in the string should be<br>the letter that replaces “a” when encrypting, the second letter in the string should be the letter that replaces<br>“b”, the third letter should be the one that replaces “c” etc.<br>For example, if the string is “bzcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxya”, then “a” would be replaced with “b”, “b” would<br>be replaced with “z”, “z” would be replaced with “a” and everything else would stay the same. So, a word like<br>“zebra” would become “aezrb”.<br>When decrypting, the reverse would be done: “b” would be replaced with “a”, “z” would be replaced with<br>“b”, “a” would be replaced with “z” and everything else would stay the same. So, “aezrb” would become<br>“zebra”.<br>All right, with that in mind, are you ready to make your own secret messages?<br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>3<br>Step 1 ‐ Getting the skeleton code<br>In this task description, there is a section called Setting Up. Please read this section carefully for information<br>about the skeleton code and follow the instructions to set up your workspace.<br>Step 2 – Understanding the Encrypter class<br>For this part of the assignment (i.e. Part 1), we will be focusing on only two of the three skeleton code classes:<br>Encrypter and SecretMessages. You could think of the Encrypter class as a set of instructions for<br>making encrypters. That is, things that can encrypt and decrypt secret messages. Each encrypter has its own<br>special key for encrypting and decrypting messages, and also a setting for removing whitespace. (Recall that<br>in programming, all characters that are not visible when displayed are called collectively whitespace. Thus,<br>the whitespace includes the normal space “ ” but also the tab “\t”, new line “\n” and some other characters.)<br>This option to remove whitespace is useful, because messages without<br>spaces are harder to guess. For example, it might be easy to guess that<br>something like “T od Dto” by looking at word length, but “TodDto”<br>would be harder!<br>Sometimes you might not want to remove whitespace, though,<br>because then it’s more difficult to read the message after decrypting<br>it. For example, “IamMia” is more difficult to read than “I am Mia”.<br>Perhaps when testing your code, it would be nicer if the decryption<br>was very easy to read. So, in some cases, not removing whitespace<br>could be helpful.<br>This is why each encrypter has a removeSpaces setting. If removeSpaces is set to true, then the encrypter<br>will remove all whitespace when encrypting. If it is set to false, then the encrypter will not remove whitespace.<br>Note that the encrypter should never remove whitespace when decrypting, as this just makes the message<br>unnecessarily difficult to read.<br>Step 3 – Writing the Encrypter Class<br>You are welcome to complete this task in any order you like, but if you’re not sure where to begin, try starting<br>with the getKey and isRemovingSpaces methods in the Encrypter class.<br>The blue comments above each method tell you exactly what the method should do, and give you information<br>about input and output. Please read this carefully!<br>After you have written a method, it’s a good idea to check that it works correctly. You can do this by submitting<br>your code to PASTA. Even if you have only written one method, you can still submit your code. Remember<br>that you are allowed as many attempts as you like, so there really is no harm in doing this. To submit your<br>code, first make sure your code compiles (i.e. no red errors in Eclipse), then follow the submission instructions<br>at the end of this task description.<br>If anything seems unfamiliar, try looking at the lecture slides, tutorial questions and textbook sections on<br>object oriented design. Also, here are a few hints that you might find useful when completing these methods!<br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>4<br>Hint 1 If you have a character and want to check if it is a letter or whitespace, you can use the Character<br>methods isWhitespace and isLetter.<br>Here’s an example of how you could check if the character ‘T’ is a letter:<br>if (Character.isLetter(‘T’))<br>System.out.println(“This is a letter”);<br>Hint 2 You can easily check if a letter character is lowercase or uppercase using the following Character<br>methods: isUpperCase, isLowerCase.<br>Here is an example of how you could check if the character ‘B’ is uppercase:<br>if (Character.isUpperCase(‘B’))<br>System.out.println(“This character is an uppercase letter!”);<br>Hint 3 Want to get the lowercase equivalent of an uppercase letter, or the uppercase equivalent of a<br>lowercase letter? Well then, these Character methods are just what you need: toUpperCase,<br>toLowerCase<br>Here’s an example of how you could get ‘B’ in lowercase:<br>char lowercaseB = Character.toLowerCase(‘B’); //lowercaseB will be ‘b’<br>Hint 4 Say you have a character which is a lowercase letter, and you want to know its position in the<br>alphabet. For example, ‘a’ is in position 0, ‘b’ is in position 1, ‘c’ is in position 2 etc.<br>Here’s a simple way you can do it (note that charName is the name of the character you’re interested<br>in).<br>int position = charName - ‘a’;<br>How does this work? Well, charName and ‘a’ are converted to certain integers. ‘a’ is converted to<br>97,  ‘b’  is  converted  to  98,  ‘c’  to  99  etc.  (see  this  table  for  reference<br><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html</a> ). Then, these integers are<br>subtracted.<br>So, something like ‘c’ – ‘a’ becomes 99 – 97, which is 2. Ah! And 2 is the position of ‘c’ in the<br>alphabet. :D.<br>To find the position of an uppercase letter, just convert it to lowercase first and follow the same<br>process!<br>Hint 5 What about going backwards? What if you know the position of a letter in the alphabet and you<br>want to know what character it is? Well, we can do something similar to before!<br>Here’s how we could find the character in position 4 of the alphabet:<br>int character = (char) (4 + ‘a’); //character will be e<br>Why is this e? Well, ‘a’ is converted to 97, so we have 4+97, which is 101. Then, we convert 101<br>to a character and get ‘e’.<br><br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>5<br>Step 4 – SecretMessages Class<br>Now that we’ve made our Encrypter class, it’s time to use it!<br>Write a program in the class SecretMessages that creates an encrypter and allows the user to do various<br>things with this encrypter.<br>This encrypter should initially:<br> use the key  “zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy”  to encrypt and decrypt messages<br> be set to not remove spaces<br>The program should give the user 5 different choices of things to do with the encrypter:<br>1. encrypt a message<br>2. decrypt a message<br>3. check the key<br>4. change the key<br>5. change the space-removal mode.<br>After the user has made a choice, the program should use the encrypter to perform their choice. Then, it should<br>allow them to make another choice and it should perform that action. It should keep allowing the user to make<br>choices until they decide to quit. See the next section for some examples.<br>Example Input/Output<br>The following are some examples of input/output. Note that the black text is output, and the green text is<br>input.<br>Example 1:<br>What would you like to do?<br>1 ‐ encrypt a message<br>2 ‐ decrypt a message<br>3 ‐ check the key<br>4 ‐ change the key<br>5 ‐ change space mode<br>other ‐ quit<br>1<br>Enter a message to encrypt<br>Quokkas are amazing! :D<br>The encrypted message is: Ptnjjzr zqd<br>zlzyhmf! :C<br>What would you like to do?<br>1 ‐ encrypt a message<br>2 ‐ decrypt a message<br>3 ‐ check the key<br>4 ‐ change the key<br>5 ‐ change space mode<br>other ‐ quit<br>2<br>Enter a message to decrypt<br>Ptnjjzr zqd zlzyhmf! :C<br>The decrypted message is: Quokkas are<br>amazing! :D<br>What would you like to do?<br>1 ‐ encrypt a message<br>2 ‐ decrypt a message<br>3 ‐ check the key<br>4 ‐ change the key<br>5 ‐ change space mode<br>other ‐ quit<br>q<br>Quitting.

Goodbye.<br><br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>7<br>Part 2 – Descryption Decryption<br>In the last section, you made your own encrypter to encrypt and decrypt your own secret messages. This<br>worked by swapping letters around. You also saw that you could remove spaces to make those messages more<br>difficult to decrypt. Of course, if you wanted to go a step further, you could also remove capitalisation and<br>punctuation. This would leave just a big block of letters.<br>If someone handed you a long block of letters like that and you had to decrypt the message without the key,<br>what would you do? It might seem like a difficult task, but we can use a special trick!<br>Say you read a text in plain English, and found that the most common letter was “e”. Then, you read an<br>encrypted message and found that the most common letter was “z”. Would you be able to guess what that “z”<br>actually was? Probably! If the most common letter in English was ‘e’, then there would be good evidence to<br>think that that “z” was actually an “e”!<br>You could do something similar with the rest of the letters! You could get a list of all the letters in English<br>ranked based on how frequently they occur and a list of all letters in the encrypted message ranked in the same<br>way. Then you could try to match up the letters in the lists to guess the key!<br>Of course, this might not always work out exactly. For example, it might be tricky trying to decrypt a novel<br>with no e’s in it! (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel" target="_blank" rel="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel</a>) ). However, it can be useful in giving you a<br>general idea of which letter could be which, and you could try out different combinations! Generally, the<br>longer the encrypted message, the better this method will work.<br>With all of this in mind, it’s time to finally discover what the encrypted part of the task description says!<br>The encrypted message is quite short, which means that the distribution of letters not exactly the same as<br>general English. So, to make things a little simpler, we are providing a reference text to use. If you count the<br>number of times each letter appears in the reference text, and sort the letters based on how often they appear,<br>the list will be the same as the encrypted text.<br>A reference text of standard English<br>This is some sample text to use as a reference. Have you heard of quokkas? They’re really<br>cute Australian animals that seem like little roos with big puffy cheeks! If you want to<br>see one, the best way is to fly to Perth, then catch a ferry over to Rottness<em> island.<br>There are apparently about 10,000 on Rottness</em> island. Wow! Sometimes, if you have superb<br>selfie skills, you can take a selfie with them! They often look like they’re smiling,<br>which makes them very photogenic! Tortoises are also very q-ute. They have shells, you<br>see. Tortoises might eat juicy fish. Did you hear fish is ‘poisson’ in French? Tortoises<br>are better than fish. Juice is tastier than wine. Is juice a good prize?<br>Nnnnnooooooooooooo! This sentence is still strange. quip, quid, quiz, quote, quit. Good<br>dogs/ pups meet bugs under beds. Ponds. Pepper. Mind mood.<br>*Actually spelt “Rottnest”, but we needed less t’s….<br>Your task now is to finish the class FrequencyDecryption. We have written many of the methods for you<br>– you only need to write getKey and printTaskDescription.<br>What could the secret message say?<br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>8<br>Example Output<br>The secret message is:<br>Well, we can’t tell you what the secret message is in the example output, but<br>it should be in this form at least. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah<br>blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah<br>blah blah blah blah blah etc.<br>Setting Up<br>Setting up your workspace<br>In Eclipse, create a project “info1103_task3”. In this project, create a package “cryptography”. Then, create<br>three classes within this package: Encrypter, SecretMessages and FrequencyDecryption.<br>Downloading the skeleton code<br>Download the skeleton code from PASTA for these three classes. Then, you can either import these classes,<br>or copy and paste the skeleton code into each of the classes you made.<br>Methods to complete<br>Take a quick look at the skeleton code. You’ll notice that, in some methods, there is one of the following<br>comments:<br>//TODO complete this method<br>//TODO complete this constructor<br>These are the methods that you will need to write for this assignment. You don’t need to modify any of the<br>methods that don’t have one of these comments – we have already done these for you!<br>NOTE: we recommend that you read the rest of the task description before you start writing any of the<br>methods!!<br><br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>9<br>Methods already return values!<br>You might notice that, in some of the methods you need to complete, we have added a return statement to<br>the skeleton code. For example,<br>public String getKey()<br>{<br>return “”; //TODO delete this when you write this method<br>}<br>This has been done to make your code compile. That way, you can submit to PASTA even if you haven’t<br>written some of the methods.<br>When you start writing a method, delete this return statement and replace it with your own code.<br>Method headers<br>Each method has a header, such as:<br>public boolean setKey(String newKey)<br>Please do not modify these headers at all because we use them to test your code.<br>Additional methods<br>You are welcome to add any additional methods to the skeleton code if you would like to.<br>Method Comments<br>Finally, you’ll notice there are blue comments above each method, which describe what each method does,<br>what the parameters should be, and what the method will return depending on the input. Before writing any<br>methods, it’s very important to read these comments carefully, so you can make sure your method does exactly<br>what it should!<br>Submission Instructions<br>Submitting in PASTA<br>1. Before submitting, you should zip your source code files. Open the folder containing the classes<br>Encrypter.java, SecretMessages.java and FrequencyDecryption.java. If you have<br>trouble finding the src folder, first find and open your workspace folder. Then, open the folder<br>“info1103_task3”. The src folder will be inside. Navigate into the src folder, right click on the<br>“cryptography” folder and choose “Send to -&gt; Compressed (Zipped) folder”.<br>2. Log in to PASTA (<a href="http://info1103.it.usyd.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://info1103.it.usyd.edu.au/</a>) with your Unikey login and password.<br>Note: If you are off-campus, you will need to establish a VPN connection to access PASTA. This means installing<br>a program called “VPN client” on your computer and running it every time when you use PASTA off-campus.<br>Instructions how to do this are available here:<br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>10<br><a href="http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/519/~/how-do-i-download-and-install-the-vpn-client-to-" target="_blank" rel="external">http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/519/~/how-do-i-download-and-install-the-vpn-client-to-</a><br>access-the-university-network%3F<br>If you have problems with VPN, try synchronising your password:<br><a href="https://www.auth.usyd.edu.au/extro/pwresync/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.auth.usyd.edu.au/extro/pwresync/</a><br>If this doesn’t work, contact the ICT helpdesk: <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/ict/student/contact/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://sydney.edu.au/ict/student/contact/</a><br>3. Find Task 3 and press “Submit”. Then press “Choose File” and attach the zipped source files, then<br>press “I accept” (after reading the University policy on academic honesty).<br>4. If you see a message indicating that your code is queued for testing under Task 3, this means that your<br>code has been uploaded successfully.<br>5. If you see a red error box, you need to fix any problems indicated before your submission will be<br>accepted.<br>6. Once your program has been tested, the page will tell you to refresh for results, so refresh the page.<br>You should see green, red and grey boxes. Each box corresponds to a test; a red box indicates that your<br>program has failed the respective test, a green box indicates that your program has passed the test, and<br>a grey box indicates that the test is hidden (you will not see the result of the test until after the due<br>date).<br>7. If you have red boxes, you can see which tests were not passed by clicking on the task name. Correct<br>the errors (go to Eclipse, re-write your code and test it carefully) and then submit again in PASTA.<br>8.  For further help on using PASTA, check the INFO1103 User Manual, or post a question on Piazza.<br>You can submit as many times as you want. Please make sure that your program compiles and runs before<br>you submit it in PASTA. Your last submission will be the one that will be marked.<br>Marking<br>5 marks will be allocated for the Encrypter and SecretMessages classes (core part of the task) and 2<br>marks for the FrequencyDecryption (extension part of the task).<br>Your mark is the percentage of the tests that you have passed. For example, if you pass half of the tests for the<br>core part of the task and all of the tests for the extension, you will receive 50% of 5 marks + 100% of 2 marks<br>= 4.5 marks total. If you do not attempt the extension part of the test, the maximum mark you can get is 5/7.<br><br><br><br></font>
