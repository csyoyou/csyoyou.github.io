Links will be provided on the eLP for<br>electronic submission of your work.<br>Marking and feedback will be available within the following 3 weeks in class<br>or via an appointment, or via e-mail.<br>Weighting towards Module 70%<br>Learning Objectives Covered The following learning objectives are either<br>fully or partially covered by this assignment:<br>1. Analyse and specify a programming problem.<br>2. Design a high-level solution to the problem using object oriented and<br>general imperative programming language constructs.<br>3. Write, compile, execute, test and debug an OO program, which maps the<br>high-level design onto concrete programming constructs, using appropriate<br>documentation standards and software tools.<br>4. Critically evaluate the methodologies and conceptual tools used in devel-<br>oping solutions to programming problems.<br>The two main themes of this assignment are programming graphical user inter-<br>faces in Java and using inheritence in Java.<br>The work is set in week 9 of the module by which time you will have covered<br>the key concepts required to complete the work. However, you may find that<br>some of the material discussed after the Easter Vacation may be of use in your<br>implementation of the program.<br>1<br>Problem Specification<br>You are going to provide a version of the loans recording system (assignment 1)<br>with a GUI and some extra functionality.<br>The system needs to be expanded to include items for sale as well as items for<br>loan. The system should hold a price and a number in stock for a sale-item,<br>and a borrower and a return-date for a loan item. Thus there will be two types<br>of Item in the collection.<br>1. LoanItem: consisting of item ID and item description plus a borrower and<br>a return date; the ID consists of the letters LN followed by a three-digit<br>number;<br>2. SaleItem: consisting of item ID and description plus a price and a number<br>in stock; the ID consists of the letters SL followed by a three-digit number;<br>You are provided with two classes as a starting point for the work:<br>• Item a class representing a single item entry in the system. This class<br>contains only the ID and description; you will need to extend it to include<br>the extra data (borrower name and loan date (a long integer) in case of<br>LoanItem and description and quantity in case of SaleItem).<br>• ItemCollection a class representing the collection of item records, and<br>containing functions to save the item data (in text format) to a data file,<br>and to load item data from the file.<br>There is also a sample data file, containing IDs and descriptions only, and a<br>Main.class which illustrates loading from the data file into the item collection,<br>and saving of the item collection to the data file. More on these classes below.<br>Requirements<br>The following are essential functional requirements of the program:<br>1. The system needs to be expanded to include items for sale as well as items<br>for loan, as above.<br>• The Item class needs to be extended to classes LoanItem (record-<br>ing borrower and return data as per assignment 1) and SaleItem,<br>recording price and number in stock in addition to ID, description.<br>• The ItemCollection class needs to be extended also.<br>The ExtendedItemCollection class will inherit the ArrayList<item><br>and use this to store the two types of Item in one list, but will need<br>extra methods to support the functions set out below.<br>2<br>In particular, the Items in the collection will be a mixture of LoanItems<br>and SaleItems; your code needs to be able to distinguish these.<br>2. Your program should provide the following functions -<br>(a) issue a loan-item on loan;<br>(b) check back in a loan-item;<br>(c) sell some quantity of a sale-item (and update of the number in stock);<br>(d) list all entries;<br>(e) list all loan-item entries;<br>(f) list all loan-items currently on loan;<br>(g) list all sale-item entries;<br>3. The user interface must be a GUI.<br>Figure 1: A GUI for the application<br>General Points<br>1. You must make use of inheritance in developing this program. This should<br>involve you in extending the given Item and ItemCollection classes. Al-<br>3<br>though you may be given the source files, your program you MUST NOT<br>make any changes to these files.<br>2. All interactions must be via a GUI. Typically you can expect to make use<br>of buttons, text areas, and text fields. Your GUI should look something<br>like that depicted in figure 1.<br>3. The program should consist of a number of classes each with well defined<br>functionality. There should be a driver class to set things going; a GUI<br>class to provide the user interface; classes concerned with the address<br>book.<br>4. Your program should deal with error conditions by producing an error<br>dialogue window when the use makes a mistake (Consider the use of JOp-<br>tionPane dialogues for the error dialogues. This will require a little inves-<br>tigation on your part.)<br>5. Input could be via the ‘generic’ dialogues provided by JOptionPane; or<br>you could try making your own custom dialogues extending JDialog class.<br>6. All classes must be fully documented using Javadoc conventions.<br>7. The code you produce must adhere to the published course coding stan-<br>dards. Failure to adhere to the standards will lead to a loss of marks.<br>8. You will be expected to test your program against a suitable set of sit-<br>uations. In the documentation you should describe your testing strategy<br>(see below).<br>Design<br>You must produce design documentation. This will include a class diagram for<br>the system, a short explanation as to the general purpose of each of the classes<br>you have produced and their key methods; and a justification for any design<br>decisions you have made.<br>Implementation<br>You must provide listings for your program. The code must adhere to the Java<br>style standards as defined for the module.<br>Testing<br>You are expected to test your code. During the module we looked at strategies<br>for testing programs. You must apply these strategies to your work.<br>4<br>The testing section of your documentation indicates the approach you have<br>taken to verifying and validating your system. Just as you should not convey<br>the design of your system by presenting the code or even listing the classes,<br>you should not merely list the tests performed. Rather, discuss how tests were<br>selected, why they are sufficient, why a reader should believe that no important<br>tests were omitted, and why the reader should believe that the system will really<br>operate as desired when in use.<br>1. Strategy: An explanation of the overall strategy for testing: Black box<br>and/or white box, integration, kinds of test beds or test drivers used,<br>sources of test data, test suites. You might want to use different techniques<br>(or combinations of techniques) in different parts of the program. In each<br>case, justify your decisions.<br>2. Test Data: A set of tables showing the test data you used for each class,<br>etc. The format of the test documentation should be as follows: for each<br>test case in the tables,<br>• a unique ID<br>• a brief description of the purpose of the test<br>• the pre-conditions for running the test<br>• the test data<br>• the expected result<br>Reflection<br>You must provide a final critical evaluation of your work.<br>The reflection section is where you can generalize from specific failures or suc-<br>cesses to rules that you or others can use in future software development. What<br>surprised you most? What do you wish you knew when you started? How could<br>you have avoided problems that you encountered during development?<br>1. Evaluation: What you regard as the successes and failures of the devel-<br>opment: unresolved design problems, performance problems, etc. Identify<br>which features of your design are the important ones. Point out design<br>or implementation techniques that you are particularly proud of. Dis-<br>cuss what mistakes you made in your design, and the problems that they<br>caused.<br>2. Lessons: What lessons you learned from the experience: how you might<br>do it differently a second time round, and how the faults of the design and<br>implementation may be corrected. Describe factors that caused problems<br>such as missed milestones or to the known bugs and limitations.<br>5<br>3. Known Bugs and Limitations: In what ways does your implementation<br>fall short of the specification? Be precise. Although you will lose points<br>for bugs and missing features, you will receive partial credit for accurately<br>identifying those errors, and the source of the problem.<br>This should be 1 to 2 pages long.<br>Deliverables<br>You are expected to submit the following items:<br>1. Your working Java classes, source code and project files (if approriate).<br>JUnit test classes and sources should be included. Your Java source code<br>should<br>(a) be fully commented in the JavaDoc style;<br>(b) adhere to the defined coding standards.<br>2. a .jar file containing your application classes.<br>3. The HTML documentation produced by JavaDoc.<br>4. A report containing the following sections:<br>(a) A cover page giving your name, University ID, and module details;<br>(b) Design documentation as outlined above;<br>(c) All the test documentation outlned above;<br>(d) Your reflection and critical evaluation, as outlined above<br>(e) Brief instructions on running your program (this will not be marked);<br>Submission is electronic. Electronic Copies of your work should be sub-<br>mitted via the assignment mechanism on the eLP (Blackboard). Separate links<br>will be provided for (1) a ZIP containing your java source, classes, etc, your<br>jar file and your Javadoc-generted documentation; and (2) your report, in PDF<br>format.<br>Academic integrity<br>You must adhere to the university regulations on academic conduct. Formal<br>inquiry proceedings will be instigated if there is any suspicion of plagiarism or<br>any other form of misconduct in your work. Refer to the Universitys Assessment<br>Regulations for Northumbria Awards if you are unclear as to the meaning of<br>these terms. The latest copy is available on the University website.<br>6<br>Classes Provided<br>Your have been given the following .class files from which you will build your<br>new system:<br>• Entry.class<br>• AddressBook.class<br>The documentation for each class is also provided but you should not count on<br>seeing the source code. It is intended that you use the functionality provided<br>by these classes without modifying them in any way.<br>To use these classes<br>1. In BlueJ create the project for the assignment<br>2. Copy the .class files into the folder created for this project. They might<br>NOT appear immediately inside BlueJ although later on you may see<br>them.<br>3. Now start to add your own classes.<br>Assessment<br>Feedback will be provided at the end of the semester, about 3 weeks after<br>submission, by inerview or by e-mail.<br>The marking for the assignment is designed to reflect the general guidance given<br>on the University’s web site for the assessment of postgraduate work. Some<br>modifications to the generic criteria have been made to better reflect the nature<br>of the assignment. The marking scheme is set out below.<br>70-100 Distinction Excellent work providing evidence to a very high level of the<br>knowledge, understanding and skills appropriate to level 7. All learning<br>outcomes met, many at high level. Marks at the high end of this range<br>indicate outstanding work where all learning outcomes are met at a high<br>level. Excellent in all the specific areas of the assessment criteria listed<br>below for the assignment; evidence of successful independent learning as<br>demonstrated by the implementation of optional features in the program;<br>use of up-to-date material from a variety of sources; critical evaluation<br>and creative use of theory<br>60-69 Commendation Commendable work providing evidence to a high level<br>of the knowledge, understanding and skills appropriate to level 7. All<br>learning outcomes met, many are more than satisfied. Good in all or<br>7<br>most of: the specific assessment criteria listed below for the assignment;<br>evidence of independent learning; critical evaluation and creative use of<br>theory<br>55-59 Pass Satisfactory work providing evidence of the knowledge, understand-<br>ing and skills appropriate to level 7. All learning outcomes are met. Sat-<br>isfactory in all or most of the assessment criteria listed below.<br>50-54 Pass Adequate work providing evidence of the knowledge, understanding<br>and skills appropriate to level 7 but only at a bare pass level. All learning<br>outcomes are met (or nearly met and balanced by strengths elsewhere).<br>Adequate in all of (or most of, with balancing strength elsewhere) of the<br>criteria listed below.<br>40-49 Fail The program fails to achieve the basic pass criteria specified below.<br>Work is not acceptable in providing evidence of the knowledge, under-<br>standing and skills appropriate to level 7. May be adequate in some but<br>not all of the assessment criteria listed below.<br>1-39 Fail Work is not acceptable and provides little evidence of the knowledge,<br>understanding and skills appropriate to level 7. Few of the learning out-<br>comes are met. Inadequate in terms of the various criteria given below as<br>a basis for judging the work.<br>0 Fail Work not submitted OR Work giving evidence of serious academic<br>misconduct (subject to regulations in ARNA Appendix 1) OR Work show-<br>ing no evidence of the knowledge, understanding and skills appropriate to<br>level 7. None of the learning outcomes are met<br>1. Basic functionality: 20 marks. You must have produced code for the GUI,<br>which must compile. The program must provide via the GUI the basic<br>services provided by the original AddressBook class, e.g. add an entry,<br>find an entry, delete an entry, list all.<br>2. Coding style and quality: 20 marks.<br>• Judicious use of comments, including Javadoc comments;<br>• Good layout, good naming<br>• Good level of class and function decomposition<br>• Simple methods; appropriate use of Java language features.<br>3. Correctness: 20 marks<br>• Robust and correct user interface<br>• Errors handled cleanly.<br>• Significant use of Java object-orientation: inheritence, polymorphism.<br>• Good use of GUI features: there are marks for exploring beyond the<br>basics.<br>8<br>• Well structured listeners, with helper functions.<br>• Program logic is correct.<br>4. Testing: 20 marks<br>• JUnit: a comprehensive set of the JUnit tests; JUnit features (setup,<br>asserts) appropriately used.<br>• The test cases provided to test the program are documented in the<br>report as asked, and justified.<br>5. Report: 20 marks<br>• Design documentation: class diagram and description of roles of<br>classes and their methods; explanation of key design decisions.<br>• Critical evaluation, including issues arising from exploration of ad-<br>vanced GUI features.<br>9<br><br><br><br></item></font>
