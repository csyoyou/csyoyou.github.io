There should be no file extension after the file name “README”. Your README should<br>include the following sections:<br>Program Description ( 4 points ) : Provide a high level description of your program. Describe what your programs<br>do and how you can interact with them. Make these explanations such that your grandmother or uncle or<br>someone you know who has no programming experience can understand what this program does and how to use<br>it.<br>Write your README as if it were intended for a 5 year old. Do not assume your reader is a computer science<br>major.<br>Short Response ( 6 points ) : Answer the following questions:<br>Vim related questions (keyboard commands only – no mouse actions, ASCII characters only):<br>1. In vim, how do you move the cursor to the end of a line with a single command? To the beginning of a line<br>with a single command?<br>2. How do you highlight/select a line in vim?<br>Java related questions:<br>3. What does the keyword static mean in regards to variables?<br>4. What does the keyword static mean in regards to methods? Provide an example use of a static method.<br>5. What is overriding? Give an example from a previous/current assignment.<br>Unix related questions:<br>6. Using the cut command, how do you extract out only the columns 5 through 13 in a file named foo?<br>STYLE ( 20 points )<br>Please see previous programming assignments. A full file header for your README is not needed, but you still need to<br>put your name and cs11f login at the top. However, all other style guidelines apply to all the files ( e.g. over 80<br>characters apply to READMEs as well. )<br>You will be specifically graded on commenting, file headers, class and method headers, meaningful variable names,<br>sufficient use of blank lines, not using more than 80 characters on a line, perfect indentation, no magic numbers/hard-<br>coded numbers other than zero and +/-1, and use of accessor/mutator methods to access private fields (getters and<br>setters) where specified.<br>CORRECTNESS ( 70 points )<br>You are asked to create an interactive 3 x 3 puzzle game for pre-schoolers. The player has to drag the puzzle pieces on<br>the right to the correct location on the left to form a complete image. This assignment does NOT involve ActiveObjects<br>or require a paint() method. The correctness of this assignment is based on meeting the required functionalities listed<br>below.<br>Part 0: Overview  BoardPieces  PuzzlePieces<br>We have a 3 x 3 puzzle, which gives us 9 puzzle pieces that are movable on the right. They can be dragged<br>anywhere on the canvas, but not off the canvas. On the left, we have a 3 x 3 board. After a puzzle piece is dragged<br>onto its correct location, the puzzle piece is “locked” into the board and is no longer movable.<br>The reason “locked” is in quotes is because the puzzle piece is actually not locked. We created this illusion by<br>having two different types of Pieces here: PuzzlePiece and BoardPiece. When a PuzzlePiece (movable piece on the<br>right) is dragged onto a BoardPiece (fixed piece on the left), your program will do some verification to see if they<br>match. If so, it’s going to hide the PuzzlePiece and reveal the BoardPiece with the same image as the PuzzlePiece.<br>So it may seem like the PuzzlePiece is locked in place, but it’s actually a different BoardPiece that’s displayed on<br>the canvas. Now that we know the basic idea/hack behind this game, how do we implement it?<br>Part 1: Useful Interfaces<br>Take advantage of interfaces! We have two different kinds of Piece types here, but they share a lot in common.<br>We’ll implement the Piece interface later in PuzzlePiece and BoardPiece classes.<br>1. The Highlightable interface is used to draw borders and highlights around each piece:<br>import java.awt.Color;<br>public interface Highlightable {<br>public abstract void showHighlight( Color color );<br>public abstract void hideHighlight();<br>}<br>2. The Hideable interface is used to hide and show pieces:<br>public interface Hideable {<br>public abstract void show();<br>public abstract void hide();<br>}<br>3. The Piece interface, which extends the two interfaces above and includes a few other methods:<br>import objectdraw.<em>;<br>public interface Piece extends Highlightable, Hideable {<br>public abstract boolean contains(Location point);<br>public abstract boolean equals(Object o);<br>public abstract Location getCenter();<br>public abstract int getId();<br>public abstract void move(double dx, double dy);<br>}<br>Part 2: Piece Classes<br>You will create 2 Piece classes: class BoardPiece and class PuzzlePiece.<br>Each of these classes will implement the Piece interface. For example:<br>public class BoardPiece implements Piece { … }<br>Each Piece class will hold the specifics about that piece:<br>•  the piece image (a VisibleImage created from passing an Image object to its constructor)<br>•  ID (integer indexed from 0 to 8 in order of left to right and top to bottom, each ID represents a piece with<br>a distinct image)<br>•  center (a Location object that represents the center point of this piece)<br>•  borders/highlights (PuzzlePiece (the movable pieces on the right) has one black FramedRect object right<br>on top of the edge of the image and wraps around it as the border. BoardPiece (the fixed pieces on the<br>left) has two FramedRect objects, one right on top of the edge of the image, and one that’s inset by 1px,<br>so it creates a thicker outline. When the game first starts, BoardPiece should only display the outer<br>highlight as black.)<br>Thus, the constructor for BoardPiece and PuzzlePiece should be identical. For example:<br>public BoardPiece(Image img, int id, Location loc, DrawingCanvas canvas) { … }<br>Each Piece class will also implement the methods from the Piece interface.<br>•  showHighlight() and hideHighlight() can access and change the visibility of the FramedRect objects that<br>highlight each piece.<br>•  show() in PuzzlePiece should show the image and the black FramedRect highlight. show() in BoardPiece<br>should just show the image. We will call showHighlight() when we want to display the green highlight to<br>indicate the puzzle piece is in the correct spot on the board (more on this later).<br>•  hide() in PuzzlePiece should hide the image and the highlight. hide() in BoardPiece does nothing unless<br>you plan to implement the extra credit.<br>•  contains() in PuzzlePiece determines whether some point is contained in the VisibleImage associated with<br>that piece (Hint: use VisibleImage’s contains() method). contains() method in BoardPiece requires a little<br>more logic. If you are giving this puzzle to someone, you don’t want him/her to solve this so quickly by just<br>dragging the PuzzlePieces close enough to the BoardPieces so they get locked in automatically. If you are<br>the player, you also don’t want to be forced to drag the PuzzlePiece so your cursor/PuzzlePiece falls<br>perfectly within the BoardPiece. So what we are going to do here is add a different check: instead of<br>passing the point where the cursor is, we are going to pass the center of the PuzzlePiece we are dragging<br>to contains(). If the center of the PuzzlePiece is within a 50 by 50 pixels square in the center of the<br>BoardPiece, then we can say “the point is contained” in the BoardPiece. What we are really checking here<br>is whether the center of the PuzzlePiece is contained in the 50 x 50px square in the BoardPiece.<br>•  equals() checks if two Pieces are equal (for example, does the PuzzlePiece match with the BoardPiece in<br>the board grid?). This is done by checking the unique ID (0 - 8) we assigned to each piece.<br>•  getId() returns the unique ID of the Piece.<br>•  getCenter() returns the center of the Piece.<br>•  move() in BoardPiece should do nothing since BoardPieces are fixed. You would have to add some<br>implementation if you decide to do extra credit. move() in PuzzlePiece is in charge of moving the<br>PuzzlePiece around. There’s one tricky thing about this method… you need to make sure that the<br>PuzzlePieces cannot be dragged off the canvas. More specifically, the center of PuzzlePiece should not be<br>able to move off the canvas.<br>Part 3: class Puzzle<br>Now we’ve set up the building blocks for this game, we can start implementing the controller Puzzle class. Class<br>Puzzle should extend WindowController and include main() that starts a new instance of Acme.MainFrame. The<br>canvas size should be 735 by 380 pixels.<br>Part 3a: Get Images<br>Nine 100px x 100px puzzle piece images are available for you in ~/../public/PA5-images/. They are numbered<br>from p0 to p8 (e.g. p0.jpg, p1.jpg, …).<br>In order to load these images into the program, use the getImage() method in class Puzzle (the main GUI controller<br>that implements WindowController). For example:<br>getImage(“p0.jpg”);<br>We need to load 9 images into an Image array (array of Image objects). Instead of hardcoding 9 lines of<br>getImage(), we can do this in a loop using some string concatenation. getImage() will return an Image object. You<br>should pass each Image object as an actual argument to each the of Board/PuzzlePiece’s constructor, and inside<br>that Board/PuzzlePiece’s constructor, make a VisibleImage object based on the Image object.<br>Part 3b: Layout<br>The main Puzzle class will also layout the BoardPieces and the PuzzlePieces as seen in the earlier screenshots.<br>Again, instead of hardcoding 18 different locations, we are going to use two arrays to store Locations, one for<br>BoardPieces and one for PuzzlePieces. The good news is that the constants and the formulas of calculating these<br>Locations have been worked out for you:<br>private static final int PIECES_PER_COL = 3; // can be changed to expand the puzzle<br>private static final int PIECES_PER_ROW = 3; // can be changed to expand the puzzle<br>private static final int PUZZLE_SPACING = 20; // num of px between PuzzlePieces<br>private static final int PUZZLE_OFFSET = 355; // offset from left side of canvas<br>private static final int BOARD_MARGIN_X = 25; // left margin of the board<br>private static final int BOARD_MARGIN_Y = 40; // top margin of the board<br>private static final int SIDE_LENGTH = 100; // side length of each Piece<br>BoardPiece with index i is located at<br>x = BOARD_MARGIN_X + SIDE_LENGTH </em> (i % PIECES_PER_COL)<br>and<br>y = BOARD_MARGIN_Y + SIDE_LENGTH <em> (i / PIECES_PER_ROW).<br>PuzzlePiece with index i is located at<br>x = PUZZLE_OFFSET + PUZZLE_SPACING </em> (i % PIECES_PER_COL + 1)<br>+ SIDE_LENGTH <em> (i % PIECES_PER_COL)<br>and<br>y = PUZZLE_SPACING </em> (i / PIECES_PER_ROW + 1) + SIDE_LENGTH * (i / PIECES_PER_ROW).<br>These x and y coordinates represent the upper left corners of the VisibleImage in each Piece. You can check the<br>math if you are curious what’s up with all these mods and divides.<br>Before you place all the Pieces onto the canvas, add a Text object as the winning message “YOU WON!” at x = 355<br>and y = the Y value of the fourth BoardPiece. It should have font size of 55 in bold and green. Hide the winning<br>message for now, and we will come back to it later (the order of creation matters here because it affects the<br>drawing arrangement).<br>Now let’s put the Pieces onto the canvas. Placing the BoardPieces is easy. We already have the Image array and<br>the Location array for BoardPieces. We just need another array of the interface type Piece to keep track of the<br>BoardPieces. We will go through the Image array and the Location array and create BoardPieces in order. Each<br>BoardPiece ID should match with its index in the Piece array.<br>For PuzzlePieces though, we want to pick one of the nine images randomly. We can do so by implementing a<br>method called getRandomPuzzlePiece() that takes in Location and DrawingCanvas. This method will use a<br>RandomIntGenerator that randomly generates an integer between 0 and 8. We will first check if this randomly<br>generated index represents an image that’s already used. If so, we want to get another random index until we find<br>an unused one, because every PuzzlePiece should have a unique image. Once we’ve found an unused index, we<br>can create a new PuzzlePiece. We are going to return this Piece we randomly created and store a reference to it in<br>a Piece array. We’ll do this 9 times to place all the PuzzlePieces. Note that the ID in PuzzlePiece is NOT associated<br>with its random array index but with the unique piece image.<br>To avoid using magic numbers like 8, you can create a MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES constant. In our case,<br>MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES is 9. When we need to use this as an index, we can do MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES – 1, which<br>takes care of the offset from zero-based indexing.<br>Hooray! Now you should be able to see all the BoardPieces and PuzzlePieces on your canvas. But we are not quite<br>there yet. Your GUI controller (class Puzzle) needs to handle all the mouse events and the logic of verifying the<br>Pieces. Take a break before you proceed. :)<br>Part 3c: Dragging PuzzlePiece<br>By PA5, you should be pretty familiar with onMousePress(), onMouseDrag(), and onMouseRelease(). The logic is<br>still the same. You want to keep a reference to lastPoint and find the difference between lastPoint and current<br>point. You do need to do one additional thing here, and that is keep track of which PuzzlePiece is being grabbed.<br>You can do so by looping through the Piece array holding all the PuzzlePieces and find which PuzzlePiece contains<br>the point.<br>Part 3d: Verifying PuzzlePiece<br>Hmmm… Where should you be checking if the puzzle piece has been placed (not while still dragging) in the correct<br>spot on the board to the left? There’s only one place, and I’ll let you answer it (HINT: it is NOT in onMouseDrag()).<br>But I’ll walk you through how to verify a puzzle piece has been placed correctly. Remember many words ago, we<br>said if the center of the PuzzlePiece is within a 50 by 50 pixels square in the center of the BoardPiece, we can say<br>the PuzzlePiece is “contained” in the BoardPiece (this check is already done in contains()). Here, the methods<br>you’ve implemented in BoardPiece and PuzzlePiece come in handy. You can use getCenter() to get the center of<br>the grabbed puzzle piece and call contains() on every BoardPiece in a loop. If we were able to find a BoardPiece<br>that contains the center of the grabbed puzzle piece AND they are equal (matching IDs), then we can go ahead and<br>“lock” this Piece. Again, the “locking”<br>is done by hiding the grabbed puzzle<br>piece and showing the BoardPiece as<br>described in the overview. Don’t<br>forget to show green highlights<br>around the BoardPiece to let the pre-<br>schoolers know that they’ve placed<br>the Piece correctly!<br>Part 3e: Verifying Victory<br>Almost there… I can hear the sound of victory! How can we check if the puzzle is finished? One easy way to do this<br>is having yet another array. This array will contain booleans that represent whether a Piece has been “locked”.<br>Since the Pieces have unique IDs from 0 to 8, we can just use those as indices and mark them true as they get<br>“locked”. The game is done after every element in this boolean array becomes true. At the moment of victory, you<br>should hide the green highlights around each BoardPiece and display a seamless image composed of 9 pieces. You<br>should also show the winning message.<br>And yaaaaaay, that’s the end of this assignment.<br>Running<br>To compile your Puzzle game, type this into the terminal:<br>&gt; javac -cp ./Acme.jar:./objectdraw.jar:.

Don’t worry about dragging the<br>image off canvas (you can always resize the canvas and get it back).<br>2. Clicking after Winning [2.5pts total]<br>The pre-schoolers just can’t stop playing your puzzle again and again, but their teacher is not always there to<br>restart the game for them. To make it easier for them, add a feature so that clicking anywhere on the complete<br>image of the puzzle will restart the game. You’d want to add an onMouseClick() and reinitialize many things (Hint:<br>You don’t need to reinitialize the Image array or the Text object). Clicking on the white space should do nothing.<br>NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS ACCEPTED!<br>START EARLY!<br>…and  HAVE FUN!<br><br><br></font>
