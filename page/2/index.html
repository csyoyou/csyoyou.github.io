        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>中级难度<br><br>完成意大利儿童纸牌游戏的完整版。居于上一次作业的重构和改进，主要游戏的游戏规则，<br>根据规则写相关的操作逻辑，并且完成测试。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>CS1210 Computer Science I: Foundations<br>Homework 5: Ruba Mazzetto, Completed<br>Due Monday, October 31 at 11:59PM<br>Introduction<br>In Homework 4, you completed the simple implementation of the Italian children’s card game called<br>Ruba Mazzetto. In this homework, we’ll finally finish the complete version of the game that pits you<br>against any number of other players, and includes provisions for taking more than one card each turn. In<br>the interest of brevity, you can refer to the descriptions of Homework 3 and Homework 4 for more<br>information about the game.<br>Background<br>For this assignment, we’ll start with a refactored version of the Homework 4 solution, that incorporates<br>one small change to the rules of the game 1 and significantly revamps the structure of the play() function.<br>Your job is to complete this refactored version to support taking more than one card per turn, where the<br>cards matched must sum to the value of the card played. So, for example, the solution to Homework 5 will<br>behave as follows (excerpt taken from the middle of a 3-player game):<br>Pl aye r 0 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 1] 7♠ (<em>3) , [P l aye r 2] 6♥ (</em>2)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦, [4] 3♦<br>My hand : [0] 10♣, [1] 10♠<br>Pl ay wh i ch ca rd? 0<br>Se l ec t ma t ch i ng i nd ece s sepa r a t ed by spa c es (b l ank t o d i sca rd) : 1 4<br>Pl aye r 0 p l ays 10♣ and . . .<br>. . . . t ake s 3♦ f rom t ab l e<br>. . . . s t ea l s p l aye r 1 s t ash 7♠<br>=========<br>Pl aye r 1 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 0] 10♣ (<em>5) , [P l aye r 2] 6♥ (</em>2)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦<br>Pl aye r 1 p l ays 6♦ and . . .<br>. . . . s t ea l s p l aye r 2 s t ash 6♥<br>=========<br>Pl aye r 2 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 0] 10♣ (<em>5) , [P l aye r 1] 6♦ (</em>3)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦<br>Pl aye r 2 add s 1♦ t o t ab l e<br>1<br>The small change referred to here has to do with what happens to the cards that remain on the table at the end<br>of the game. In the ‘‘real’’ version of the game, the last person to match cards from the table or another player’s<br>stash is gifted all of the remaining cards on the table when everyone else has finished playing their cards. This<br>change has been incorporated into the play() function.<br>1 Revised October 24, 2016<br>Note how Player 0 uses the 10♣ to match a 3♦ from the table and the 7♣ from Player 1’s stash (because<br>10 = 3 + 7).<br>As for HW4, to make this homework feasible, you will be provided a code skeleton containing nearly all<br>of the code you will need for the solution. Your assignment is to complete the functions getMove() and<br>pickMove(), but you should begin by studying the code skeleton file carefully.<br>def play(N=2, K=10)<br>The play() function has undergone the most significant reworking since the previous assignment. Aside<br>from an additional variable, which changes the parameters of the deck you play with, the big change is in<br>the main iteration that continues until the deck is exhausted. Previously, this loop was divided into two<br>sections: one for the human player and one for everyone else. The new structure merges these two<br>sections into a single loop and relegates the differentiation of the human player from the computer<br>player(s) to getMove(). The last change to play() involves assignment of any cards remaining on the table<br>to the last player who successfully matched, a job handled by the addition of a variable, last, that is reset<br>each time a player makes a match.<br>def getMove(i, N, H, T, P)<br>The purpose of getMove() has changed significantly from HW4. In HW4, getMove() was to return a<br>single ‘‘best’’ move for a given (automated) player, where each move consisted only of matching a single<br>card from the player’s hand with a single card from the table or the top card from an opposing player’s<br>stash. But now that we permit matching a single card from the player’s hand with the sum of multiple<br>cards from the table or from the top of each opposing player’s stash, we need to generate and then<br>consider the space of all possible legal moves. Each move is represented as (c, M), where c is the index<br>into the player’s hand correspond to the card they will play and M is a list of indeces selected from the<br>table and/or the opposing player’s stashes such that sum(M)≡ H[i][c][0]. If (c, M) is (c,[]), then the<br>move corresponds to discarding c to the table.<br>Your job is to implement helper(c,v, j, M, L) to generate all legal moves, from which one will be<br>selected and returned as the value of getMove(). Let’s examine getMove() more closely:<br>(1)  The first step is to determine if the argument i relates to the human player (i ≡0). If so, then move<br>selection is relegated to pickMove().<br>(2)  The second step invokes the as-yet-unwritten helper function helper(c,v, j, M, L) repeatedly<br>(once for each card held by the current player) to generate the list L of all legal moves.<br>(3)  The third step returns a random card to discard if no legal moves were found.<br>(4)  The final step returns the legal move that maximizes the number of cards captured by the current<br>player (note that other heuristics might be used to make a ‘‘best’’ move selection from the list L of<br>legal moves).<br>The helper() function is a recursive function that constructs the set of legal moves. If you think of the<br>len(T) cards on the table and the up to N − 1 player stashes (excluding the current player’s stash) as<br>defining a space of size 2 len(T)+N−1 , you will need to enumerate the up to this many card combinations by<br>considering possible inclusion or exclusion of each successive card. The arguments to<br>helper(c,v, j, M, L) are designed to help you do so.<br>(1)  The first argument, c, is the index of the card you are trying to match from player i’s hand.<br>(2)  The second argument, v, initially the value of c, represents how many ‘‘points’’ remain to match<br>with the addition of each successive card. When this number reaches 0, you know the cards<br>you’ve selected so far sum to the original value you were trying to match.<br>2 Revised October 24, 2016<br>(3)  The third argument, j, initially 0, is the index of the card you are currently considering adding to<br>the legal move you are construction. On each successive recursive call, you’ll increase j by 1 to<br>indicate you are going to consider the next card, from 0 through N up to N + len(T) − 1. At each<br>recursive step, you will want to explore both adding the jth card to the current legal move or not<br>adding it.<br>(4)  The fourth argument, M, initially [], is the legal move under construction. Each time you elect to<br>include an additional card, you will need to extend M to include that card’s index.<br>(5)  The last argument, L, initially [], is the list of legal moves you have found so far. Each new leg al<br>move you discover should be added to L, and the updated L should be the value returned from<br>helper().<br>def pickMove(i, N, H, T, P)<br>pickMove() is called by getMove() when the first argument i to getMove() corresponds to the human<br>player. pickMove() interacts with the user to obtain a legal move (c, M). Note that pickMove() must<br>guarantee that the move is both legal in every sense and that the cards selected from the table and the top<br>of any opposing player’s stash do, in fact, sum to the value of the card selected from the player’s hand.<br>The Ground Rules<br>Because this class is part of the NSF study we have previously described to you, the ground rules may<br>differ slightly section by section. In your section, you will start working on your assignment in discussion<br>section and continue working on it in next week’s discussion section. We ask that you upload a partial<br>solution to ICON at the end of each session (this will not be graded, it is just to see how far you get during<br>the discussion section). You will also be asked to answer a short survey about your experience after each<br>discussion section. Once you upload your final solution to ICON (when the assignment is complete),<br>your will be asked to fill out a separate short survey about your work on the assignment.<br>Just as a reminder, under no circumstances should you turn in the work of someone else (including any<br>code or material you may find on the Internet) as your own, nor should you share your own work with<br>others. It is fine, however, to discuss general concepts with your classmates as long as these discussions<br>do not lead to the actual exchange of code fragments or written solutions.<br>You hav e several sources for help. Your first recourse should always be to post your question on the ICON<br>discussion board. This is the fastest place to go for clarifications or disambiguation, or for help with<br>Python in general (remember, don’t post your solution or any part of your solution). Second, if you must<br>share a portion of your code, you can always attend a TA help session (see the announcement on ICON<br>entitled General TA Office Hours start Thursday, September 1 for times and locations). You may also<br>attend my office hours Tuesdays from 1:30 to 3:30 in my office (14 MLH). Finally, you may email your<br>code with a specific question to me or to your TA, but please be sure that you include CS1210 on the<br>subject line (also, this is the slowest way of getting help, due to the volume of mail we are likely to<br>receive).<br>What to Hand In<br>As before, for credit, you must make sure your function definitions exactly match the ‘‘signatures’’ giv en<br>in this problem specification. Your files should be uploaded to the HW5 dropbox folder in ICON by the<br>specified time and date: late assignments will not be accepted.<br>You should start building your solution file according to the template at the end of this assignment (the<br>template file, hw5.py, can be downloaded from ICON), substituting your own name for mine, obviously.<br>obviously. Note that the template file is incomplete and will not load in its present state.<br>3 Revised October 24, 2016<br>Make sure that you follow the instructions given for each function exactly, as the autograder expects these<br>functions to follow the naming convention shown. Also note the use of the comment character, #, at the<br>beginning of each line that is not intended to be interpreted by Python. You should use comments liberally<br>to explain what you are doing to the human reader.<br>4 Revised October 24, 2016<br><br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>中级难度<br><br>主要实现了细胞生成游戏。<br>需要实现游戏的逻辑代码，以及界面仿真代码。<br><br>首先：<br>完成代码的逻辑编写。比如活细胞和无细胞在不同的邻居个数的情况下，<br>下一代会是活细胞或者无细胞的判断。<br><br>其次需要实现接口函数，来显示不同的使用策略。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>The Game of Life is a well-known mathematical game that gives rise to amazingly<br>complex behavior, although it can be specified by a few simple rules. (It is not actually a<br>game in the traditional sense, with players competing for a win.) Here are the rules. The<br>game is played on a rectangular grid. Each square on the grid can be either empty<br>(represented by a 0 in our version) or occupied by a “living” cell (represented by a 1). At<br>the beginning, you can specify empty and occupied cells in some way; then the game<br>runs automatically. In each generation, the next generation is computed. A new cell is<br>born on an empty square if it is surrounded by exactly three occupied neighbor cells. A<br>cell dies of overcrowding if it is surrounded by four or more living neighbors, and it dies<br>of loneliness if it is surrounded by zero or one living neighbor. A neighbor is an occupant<br>of an adjacent square to the left, right, top, or bottom or in a diagonal direction. Figure 16<br>shows a cell and its neighbor cells.<br>Many configurations show interesting behavior when subjected to these rules. Figure 17<br>shows a glider, observed over five generations. Note how it moves. After four<br>generations, it is transformed into the identical shape, but located one square to the right<br>and below.<br>One of the more amazing configurations is the glider gun: a complex collection of cells<br>that, after 30 moves, turns back into itself and a glider (see the large figure at the end).<br>Over the next two weeks, you will use Python to program the game to eliminate the<br>drudgery of computing successive generations by hand. Your homework assignment will<br>come in two parts, also known as Programming Assignment 6 and Programming<br>Assignment 7. The Wikipedia page on The Game of Life has a lot of useful information,<br>as well as some real-time examples of program behavior. You should take a look at it.<br>Implementing this game requires a plan for what to do about the cells at the edges of the<br>grid, since those cells don’t have a full complement of eight neighbors. The Wikipedia<br>entry does bring up this issue, and options range from simple to complex. For our<br>purposes, it is sufficient to assume that every square outside of the grid is empty (i.e., 0)<br>and will remain empty for the duration of the game.<br>(Much of the description above, and all the figures below, is borrowed from a textbook<br>by Cay Horstmann.)<br>Programming Assignment 6 - Game of Life, Part 1<br>Your solution is to be written using Python 3. Make sure you provide comments<br>including the file name, your name, and the date at the top of the file you submit.<br>Also make sure to include appropriate docstrings for all functions.<br>The names of your functions must exactly match the names given in this assignment.<br>The order of the parameters in your parameter list must exactly match the order<br>given in this assignment.<br>For any given problem below, you may want to write additional functions other<br>than those specified for your solution. That’s fine with us.<br>The  core  problem  to  be  solved  in  the  implementation  of  the  Game  of  Life  is  how  to<br>generate  the  next  grid  from  the  current  grid.   Your  task  is  to  write  a  function  called<br>nextGen  which  expects  only  one  argument.   That  argument  is  a  two-­‐dimensional<br>table  (i.e.,  a  list  of  lists)  with  m  rows  and  n  columns,  representing  the  current  grid.<br>The  elements  of  the  table  are  either  0  (empty  square)  or  1  (occupied  square).

For  example,  given  this  initial  grid:<br>glider = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,1,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,1,0,0,0],<br>[0,1,1,1,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]<br>your function should work like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = nextGen(glider)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; y = nextGen(x)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; y<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; z = nextGen(y)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; z<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; q = nextGen(z)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; q<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>If we formatted those results nicely, we’d see a sequence like this:<br>## generation 1<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 2<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 3<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 4<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>These grids correspond to the generations in Figure 17.

Save that file until you’ve<br>completed Programming Assignment 7.<br>Submitting the Assignment<br>Do not turn in this assignment by itself. Submit it with the work you do for Programming<br>Assignment 7.<br>Saving your work<br>If you are working in the lab, you will need to copy your program to your own flash-drive<br>or save the program to your workspace on SmartSite. To save it on flash-drive, plug the<br>flash-drive into the computer (your TAs or the staff in the labs can help you figure out<br>how), open the flash-drive, and copy your work to it by moving the folder with your files<br>from the Desktop onto the flash-drive. To copy the file to your SmartSite workspace, go<br>to Workspace, select Resources, and then use the Add button next to “My Workspace”.<br>Your TAs can help you with this if you run into trouble.<br><br><br></font>

The structure of the tests<br>isn’t really as important as the testing plan, but we get to test both.<br>What to Test<br>We wanted to come up with a function for you to test that had a bit of everything: loops, selection, lists,<br>strings, dictionaries, objects, etc. But we had a bit of a conundrum. We wanted something complicated<br>enough to be interesting, but knew you were busy with your assignment, and didn’t want everyone to have<br>to spend lots of time writing a new function in order to test it.<br>That’s when it hit us. You’re already writing a function that you’ll probably want to test anyway…<br>cartesian product! It’s got everything we need, you already have to write it, and now it can help you test<br>your own code for A2. (A pretty smart move if I do say so myself).<br>How to Start<br>Before you start writing any code, you should think about coverage testing, and how we came up with a<br>test plan in lecture. Figure out all of the parameters, and the important ranges they fall into. Then write one<br>test for each possible combination of ranges. The goal here is to find one example test case for all possible<br>regions of your testing space.<br>Most of your actual tests will probably involve code that looks like this (now do you see why we made you<br>write set dict and get dict?<br>d1 = {…}<br>d2 = {…}<br>t1 = Table()<br>t2 = Table()<br>t1.set_dict(d1)<br>t2.set_dict(d2)<br>result_table = squeal.cartesian_product(t1, t2)<br>result_dict = result_table.get_dict()<br>expected_dict = {…}<br>self.assertEqual(result_dict, expected_dict)<br>What to Do<br>In a file called ex10.py, you should write a UnitTest to thoroughly test cartesian product. Your tests will<br>actually be run on a version of the code that I have written. Therefore, you will be doing black box testing<br>(you don’t know if I implemented the cartesian product or the Table class in the same way you will… in<br>fact, you can bet that I probably won’t). My cartesian product function will be in a file called squeal.py,<br>and my Table class will be in a file called database.py. Both will be placed into the same directory as your<br>UnitTest. We’ve provided you with some starter code, just to make sure you can access everything correctly.<br>What to Submit<br>Submit your ex10.py file to MarkUs as usual. Your UnitTest methods do not need any DocStrings, and<br>unless you’re doing something particularly unusual, you probably don’t need any internal comments either.<br>However, your method names and error messages should be descriptive enough to properly explain what<br>each test case does and why it’s useful. Remember that writing frivolous test cases is no better than missing<br>useful ones.<br>1<br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>低级难度<br><br>主要实现了利用三种方式来生成密码。<br>方法一： 随机法，前三位从A-Z生成，后三位从0-9生成。<br>方法二：右旋法，即参照ACSII码表来生成，比如A转换成D.<br>方法三：藏尾法，即输入一句话，从句子中的每一个单词的最后一位组成密码。<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br><br>Write a Python program that generates passwords in three different ways.<br>a)Generate a random 6 character password. The first 3 characters must be capital letters (A – Z) and the second 3 characters must be numeric characters (0 – 9).<br><br>b)Enter a secret word and then specify an amount of ‘right shift’ of the characters to encrypt your word. This simple method to encrypt data is attributed to Julius Caesar, the Roman Emperor. (If you are interested, you may like to read the following… <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank" rel="external">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher</a>). This method takes each character in a message and replaces it with one which is a certain distance (offset) along the alphabet from it (moving right). For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . . . . . A B C D E F G H I J K L M . . . +3 A B C D E F G H I J . . . If the offset is 3 then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F etc. In this case the word DIG encrypts to GLJ. In order to decrypt the word/string, simply offset by the same amount moving in the opposite direction (i.e. moving left). Instead of restricting the cipher to the alphabetic characters only, we will use all of the printable ASCII characters. That is, all the characters from ASCII 32 (Space) to ASCII 126 (~).<br><br> You will need to use the following two functions - ord(c) Given c, a string of length one ord(c), returns an integer representing the value of the string. For example: ord(‘a’) returns the integer 97. chr(i) Returns a string of one character whose ASCII code is the integer i. For example: chr(97) returns the string ‘a’.<br>c)Enter a secret sentence and create a password by taking the last letter of each word.<br><br>Write a menu driven program called yourId_encryptor.py that will allow the user to enter commands and process these commands until the quit command is entered.<br><br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>中级难度<br>主要实现了利用两个class（student，grade）来存储学生成绩等信息。<br>Class Grade：<br>实现方法：<br><strong>str</strong>，<strong>repr</strong><br><br>Class Student：<br>实现方法：<br>add_grade，calculate_grade，<strong>str</strong>，<strong>repr</strong>，<strong>gt</strong>，<strong>lt</strong>，<strong>eq</strong><br>完成两个类之后，需要完成测试文件，和app应用文件来调用这两个class。<br>app文件：<br>读取对应的student文件，存入相应的类。<br>存所有的student 实例，并且打印出来。<br>test文件：<br>用于测试以上所有的方法。<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>CSE 231  Fall 2016<br>Computer Project #11<br>(Update 12/4: clarified file prompting for proj11-app.py. Update 12/2: clarified Grade <strong>init</strong> and<br>Student <strong>str</strong> requirements. Update 11/30: clarified specifications of <strong>init</strong> and <strong>str</strong> and added a<br>note about the sample test file).<br>Assignment Overview<br>This assignment focuses on the implementation of two Python classes to store grades of students in a<br>class.<br>It is worth 55 points (5.5% of course grade) and must be completed no later than 11:59 PM on Tuesday,<br>December 6.<br>Assignment Specifications<br>You will develop “Student” and “Grade” classes and implement all the methods described in the<br>following section.<br>You will demonstrate that your implementation of the classes are correct by developing a program<br>which serves as a test bed for that class.<br>You will develop an application program which uses those classes to read “students.txt” and “grades.txt”<br>files and store their data in instances of Student and Grade classes.<br>Assignment Deliverables<br>The deliverables for this assignment are the following files:<br>classes.py  – the source code for your Student and Grade classes<br>proj11-test.py – the source code for your test program<br>proj11-app.py – the source code for your application program<br>Be sure to use the specified file names and submit them for grading via the handin system before the<br>project deadline.<br>Specifications for Class Grade<br>1. The constructor (method <strong>init</strong>) will accept 3 values as parameters, name of the<br>assignment (string), grade and assignment weight (floats). All three parameters must have<br>default values—you choose appropriate ones. Also, the attributes cannot be private because you<br>need to access them in the Student class. That is, do not use double underscores in your names,<br>i.e. do not use an attribute name such as self.<strong>name.<br>2. The string method (</strong>str<strong>) and representation method (</strong>repr<strong>) should return a string<br>that includes the name, grade and weight of the Grade object in one line.<br>Specifications for Class Student<br>1. The constructor (method </strong>init<strong>) will accept 4 values as parameters, student id (int), first<br>name (string), last name (string), and a list of all the grade objects for that student. All three<br>parameters must have default values—you choose appropriate ones, but the appropriate default<br>value for a list parameter is None, not an empty list ([]).<br>2. add_grade method should take a Grade object as a parameter and append it to a list of grades<br>for that student.<br>3. calculate_grade should multiply all the grade points of the student by their weight and<br>return the final course grade. (Each Grade object in the list has a value and weight that should be<br>multiplied together. The sum of all the calculations results the final weighted grade of the student<br>in the course)<br>4. The string method (</strong>str<strong>) and representation method (</strong>repr<strong>) should return a string<br>that has the student’s name (with last name first with a comma between the last name and first<br>name) includes all the grades of the student. This method must call the </strong>str<strong> method of the<br>Grade objects. Note that implicitly calling the </strong>str<strong> method is fine such as str() or<br>format(), but do not access the individual attributes such as grade.name.<br>5. </strong>gt<strong>, </strong>lt<strong> and </strong>eq<strong> methods should compare the final grades of two students<br>together.<br>Note that you can use calculate_grade method to calculate the final grade of two students.<br>Never use “==” to check for equality of two float numbers (because floats are approximations<br>of real numbers). Instead, find the absolute value of the difference of two numbers; if the<br>difference is less than epsilon (a very small number such as 10**-6), the floats are equal to<br>each other (that is they are close enough to consider them to be equal). Python has an absolute<br>value function: abs()<br>Please note that you may wish to use function “print” to display various items as you are developing<br>your implementation of the class. However, all invocations of function “print” must be removed from<br>the final version of your classes (or at least turned into comments).<br>Hint: check the “Student” class in page 546 of the book for reference.<br>Specifications for the Test Program<br>1. You will develop a program to serve as a test bed for classes. That is, the only purpose of the<br>program is to demonstrate that each method of your “Student” and “Grade” classes is implemented<br>correctly. The source code for your test bed will be contained in the file named “proj11-test.py”. That<br>file will import “classes.py”. A file named “proj11-test.py” is provided as a starting template.<br>2. Your test bed will not perform any input operations. Instead, all test cases will be embedded in the<br>program itself.<br>3. The output produced by your test bed must be appropriately labeled so that the reader can understand<br>the purpose and result of each test case without examining the source code. For example, when<br>demonstrating </strong>lt<strong> you might print “Demonstrating Fred &lt; Mary” followed by<br>print(Fred&lt;Mary)<br>Specifications for the Application Program<br>1. You will develop an application program which uses both classes to solve the problem described<br>below.<br>The source code for your application program will be contained in the file named “proj11-app.py”. That<br>file will import “classes.py”.<br>2. The program will attempt to access the files named “students.txt” and “grades.txt”. If any of the<br>input files cannot be opened, the program will display an appropriate message and halt. (Since the first<br>posted version of this document didn’t specify that the program must prompt for these two file names,<br>you have the option of prompting for them or not. However, if you prompt for them, our test program<br>will provide the name grades.txt to the first prompt and students.txt to the second prompt.)<br>3. The grades.txt file will contain three or more lines. The first line contains the weight of each<br>assignment, the second line contains the labels and the name of the assignments. Line 3 and subsequent<br>lines contain grade information for a student. Each line has a student id and all the grades of a student.<br>The information of each assignment should be stored in an instance of “Grade” class. A list of Grade<br>objects should be passed to the constructor of “Student” class.<br>4. The students.txt file will contain one or more lines, where each line contains the information of a<br>student. Each line has an id, first name and last name. That information should be stored in an instance<br>of “Student” class along with the list of “Grade” objects explained above.<br>5. The application should store all “Student” objects in a list and should print them ( print(student) ) like<br>the sample output provided below.<br>6. The application should print the class average at the end.<br>Assignment Notes<br>1. You would be wise to develop your implementation of “Student” and “Grade” classes and your test<br>program incrementally and in parallel. That is, implement one class method at a time and then test that<br>method by adding statements to your test program.<br>Clearly, the first class method which must be implemented and tested is the constructor (</strong>init<strong>).<br>Perhaps the second class method to implement and test is </strong>str__ so that you have a way to display<br>the value of an object of type “Student” and “Grade” using function “print”.<br>After implementing and testing those methods, you would continue to implement and test one method at<br>a time until you have completed the class.<br>Be sure to insert and test any necessary error handling at the appropriate time.<br>2. Approximately 60% of the 55 points available for the project will be allocated to the implementation<br>of “Student” and “Grade” classes, approximately 15% will be allocated to the test program, and<br>approximately 25% will be allocated to the application program.<br>Sample Output (Application file)<br>Hopper, Grace<br>proj01 : 75% 0.07<br>proj02 : 81% 0.08<br>proj03 : 91% 0.10<br>proj04 : 87% 0.10<br>proj05 : 73% 0.15<br>exam01 : 90% 0.20<br>exam02 : 86% 0.30<br>Final grade: 84%<br>Knuth, Donald<br>proj01 : 79% 0.07<br>proj02 : 73% 0.08<br>proj03 : 83% 0.10<br>proj04 : 87% 0.10<br>proj05 : 82% 0.15<br>exam01 : 97% 0.20<br>exam02 : 99% 0.30<br>Final grade: 89%<br>Goldberg, Adele<br>proj01 : 92% 0.07<br>proj02 : 82% 0.08<br>proj03 : 92% 0.10<br>proj04 : 83% 0.10<br>proj05 : 96% 0.15<br>exam01 : 92% 0.20<br>exam02 : 93% 0.30<br>Final grade: 91%<br>Kernighan, Brian<br>proj01 : 77% 0.07<br>proj02 : 95% 0.08<br>proj03 : 98% 0.10<br>proj04 : 87% 0.10<br>proj05 : 87% 0.15<br>exam01 : 85% 0.20<br>exam02 : 82% 0.30<br>Final grade: 86%<br>Liskov, Barbara<br>proj01 : 72% 0.07<br>proj02 : 82% 0.08<br>proj03 : 98% 0.10<br>proj04 : 90% 0.10<br>proj05 : 75% 0.15<br>exam01 : 98% 0.20<br>exam02 : 94% 0.30<br>Final grade: 89%<br>The class average is 88.17%<br>========================================<br>Educational Research<br>When you have completed the project insert the 5-line comment specified below.<br>For each of the following statements, please respond with how much they apply to your experience<br>completing the programming project, on the following scale:<br>1 = Strongly disagree / Not true of me at all<br>2<br>3<br>4 = Neither agree nor disagree / Somewhat true of me<br>5<br>6<br>7 = Strongly agree / Extremely true of me<br><strong><em>Please note that your responses to these questions will not affect your project grade, so please<br>answer as honestly as possible.</em></strong><br>Q1: Upon completing the project, I felt proud/accomplished<br>Q2: While working on the project, I often felt frustrated/annoyed<br>Q3: While working on the project, I felt inadequate/stupid<br>Q4: Considering the difficulty of this course, the teacher, and my skills, I think I will do well in<br>this course.<br>Please insert your answers into the bottom of your project program as a comment, formatted exactly as<br>follows (so we can write a program to extract them).<br># Questions<br># Q1: 5<br># Q2: 3<br># Q3: 4<br># Q4: 6<br><br><br><br><br></font>

Learning Goals<br>Learn how to<br>1. use associative containers like ​std::unordered_set​ and ​std::unordered_map<br>2. use iterators to iterate through associative containers<br>3. use ​algorithms​ that are available in the C++ Standard Library<br>4. pass command line arguments to a C++ program<br>5. partition a C++ program in header files (.hpp) and source files (.cpp)<br>6. read, understand, and use code written by other people<br>2. Description<br>In this assignment you’ll be doing the following:<br>1. Read a raw text file containing movie reviews and ratings.<br>2. Remove the punctuations and stopwords (e.g. is, and, the, etc.) from the reviews and<br>write the contents to a clean review file.<br>3. Associate a value for all words found in the clean reviews based on the average rating of<br>the word.<br>4. Using the map between the words and their associated values, rate reviews from<br>another file that doesn’t have any rating already.<br>5. Write the ratings of the reviews to an output file.<br>2.1. Clean the data<br>The raw data with the reviews and the rating will be present in a file named<br>rawReviewRatings.txt​. Every review is given a rating between 0 - 4 (both inclusive). The<br>following are interpretation of the rating values:<br>● 0 = Negative<br>● 1 = Somewhat Negative<br>● 2 = Neutral<br>● 3 = Somewhat Positive<br>● 4 = Positive<br>Each line of review follows the following format:<br><rating> <review><br>Example:<br>4 The Jungle Book is awesome!<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>where 4 is the rating and the text “The Jungle Book is awesome!” is the review.<br>Now, your first task is to read the contents of this file and ​clean the data!<br>The following steps needs to be performed in the same order for cleaning the data:<br>1. Read the raw reviews from an input file. e.g. ​rawReviewRatings.txt<br>2. Replace the hyphens in every line of text with spaces.<br>e.g. If the review contains the word “awe-inspiring”, then it should be split into 2 words<br>namely “awe” and “inspiring”<br>3. Split each line of text into multiple words using the space character as the delimiter.<br>e.g. “The Jungle Book is awesome!” becomes | “The” | “Jungle” | “Book” | “is” |<br>“awesome!” |<br>4. Remove the punctuation marks from the words.<br>e.g. “awesome!” becomes “awesome” and “!” becomes “”<br>5. If there are any trailing/leading whitespaces, then remove them. Remember that the<br>space character (‘ ’), tab (‘\t’), newline (‘\n’), etc. are considered as whitespaces. For a<br>complete list of whitespace characters ​this​.<br>e.g. “zootopia ” becomes “zootopia”, “hello\t” becomes “hello”, and “world\n” becomes<br>“world”<br>6. Remove the empty words. i.e. words with length == 0.<br>7. Remove single lettered words. i.e. words with length == 1.<br>8. Remove stopwords. e.g. is, and, the, etc. The list of stopwords can be found in the file<br>stopwords.txt<br>9. Write the contents of the clean data to a file named ​cleanReviewRatings.txt​.<br>2.2. Fill the dictionary<br>Using the ​cleanReviewRatings.txt file, create a map/dictionary for every word that is found in<br>this file. The dictionary is of type<br>​<br>std::unordered_map<string, std::pair<long,="" long="">&gt;.<br>We associate a pair of values for each word namely its total_rating and its total_count. For<br>example, the word “fantastic” has occurred 3 times in the file ​cleanReviewRatings.txt with<br>associated ratings of 3, 4, and 3 (see the last 3 lines in the file). Therefore the word “fantastic”<br>gets a total_rating of 10 (i.e. 3 + 4 + 3 = 10) and a total_count of 3 since it had occurred 3 times<br>in the file. In a similar way, the other entries in this map are filled up as shown below. You may<br>want to read about a ​std::pair​ to understand more about how this map is organized.<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>word total_rating total_count<br>fantastic  10  3<br>Zootopia  3  1<br>Dory  1  1<br>Finding  1  1<br>worst  0  1<br>The  6  2<br>inspiring  2  1<br>Jungle  8  2<br>Book  8  2<br>good  1  1<br>Jack  0  1<br>awesome  4  1<br>Lion  5  2<br>King  5  2<br>awe  2  1<br>Jill  0  1<br>2.3. Rate new reviews<br>Using the map/dictionary that we created in the previous step, we are going to read new unrated<br>reviews from a file (e.g. ​rawReviews.txt​) and predict a rating for each review in this file. The<br>predicted rating for each review is written to an output file named ​ratings.txt​.<br>How do we predict the ratings for the unrated reviews?<br>1. Read the input file with the unrated raw reviews (e.g. ​rawReviews.txt​).<br>2. Clean the data and produce an output file named ​cleanReviews.txt​. The process for<br>cleaning the data is exactly the same as we did in step 2.1.<br>3. Rate each review by finding the rating for each word from the map/dictionary that we<br>created in step 2.2. The rating for a line of review is the average value of the rating of all<br>the words in the review. If some word in this unrated review is not found in the<br>map/dictionary, then that word is given a neutral rating of 2. If a review is empty (i.e. the<br>review contains no words in it), then such a review is also given a neutral rating of 2.<br>e.g. Let see how we computed the rating for the 2nd review in ​cleanReviews.txt (i.e.<br>“The Lion King fantastic”). We lookup the map/dictionary that we created before and get<br>the average rating for each word in this review. The average ratings of each word in this<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>review is shown below:<br>The: 6/2 = 3<br>Lion: 5/2 = 2.5<br>King: 5/2 = 2.5<br>fantastic: 10/3 = 3.33<br>Based on these individual values, this line gets and average review of 2.83 as shown in<br>the file ​ratings.txt​.<br>Rating for this line = (3 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 3.33) / 4 = 2.83<br>We are dividing by 4 since this review contains 4 words in total.<br>Another example: “Finding Nemo great”<br>Finding: 1<br>Nemo: 2 (because it is NOT found in the map)<br>great: 2 (because it is also NOT found in the map)<br>Rating for this line = (1 + 2 + 2) / 3 = 1.67<br>4. Write the ratings for all the reviews to an output file named ​ratings.txt​.<br>A high-level process diagram of the steps explained in 2.1 - 2.3 is shown. Hope this<br>visualization helps you to understand the idea in a better way! :)<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>That’s it! Now, after completing this step you may pat yourself on the back for doing an amazing<br>job with this assignment! :) Also, if you have not taken Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning<br>before then you have just now completed your first exercise in Machine Learning. You just<br>created a program that may predict the ratings of movie reviews based on some learning it did<br>before based on some reviews that already had ratings associated with them. Well, even though<br>our algorithm is very simple, this is the basic idea behind Machine Learning. Newcomers,<br>welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence! :)<br>3. Sample Output<br>If your program runs correctly without any errors, then NO OUTPUT will be written to the<br>console. If any input/output file cannot be opened, only then your program writes some error<br>messages to the console. All error handling is already taken care of in the file ​main.cpp​.<br>3.1.

Important Details<br>1. The code for this assignment is split across 5 files.<br>a. main.cpp<br>b. a2.hpp<br>c. a2.cpp​ (This is the ONLY file you should modify!)<br>d. trim.hpp<br>e. trim.cpp<br>The .hpp files are the header files which contain only the declaration of the functions and<br>the .cpp files are the source files which contain the implementation of these functions. If<br>you want to understand more about why we have separate header and source files, then<br>maybe you should read ​this​.<br>2. Take some time to read the source code starting from the main() function that is present<br>inside the file main.cpp.<br>3. All the code you write for this assignment will only be inside the file ​a2.cpp. You should<br>not perform any file IO, print to stdout, or print to stderr in a2.cpp.<br>4. The files trim.hpp and trim.cpp are provided only to help you with trimming the<br>whitespaces in strings since doing so in C++ is not so easy as it’s in Java. You may read<br>these files to find out how to trim strings for this assignment.<br>5. You should use the following command to ​compile​​ your program.<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>$ g++ <em>.cpp -std=c++11<br>where </em>.cpp means all the .cpp files are to be compiled. You need not mention the<br>names of the .hpp files since they are included from within the .cpp files. The option<br>“-std=c++11” informs the compiler that our may contain C++11 features (e.g.<br>std::unordered_map was introduced only in C++11).<br>6. Your program takes the two files ​rawReviewRatings.txt and ​rawReviews.txt as ​command<br>line arguments​. ​​You should run your program as shown below:<br>$ ./a.out rawReviewRatings.txt rawReviews.txt<br>If you don’t give these 2 command line arguments to your program, then the following<br>error message will be printed. This error handling is already handled for you in main.cpp.<br>$ ./a.out<br>USAGE: ./a.out <reviewratingsfile> <reviewsfile><br>7. If your program works correctly without any errors, then nothing is printed to the console.<br>Only the three output files cleanReviewRatings.txt, cleanReviews.txt and ratings.txt will<br>be produced. You may even try compiling and running your program before adding any<br>code in a2.cpp to see if these 3 output files are produced. The contents of these output<br>files will be empty until the methods in a2.cpp are implemented.<br>8. You should NOT add any new functions/methods in a2.cpp.<br>9. You ​SHOULD NOT MODIFY​​ any of the following in a2.cpp:<br>a. Names of the functions<br>b. Names and types of the parameters to a function.<br>c. Return types of the functions.<br>10.An approximate number of lines of code is given for each function in a2.cpp. These are<br>the number of lines for each function in Gerald’s implementation of a2.cpp. We have<br>provided this information since it may help you to see how little code you may write if you<br>make use of the C++ Standard Library effectively. This would help you to stop and think<br>for a while before you may write a lot of code by yourself and maybe later realize that<br>you could have used some functionality from the standard library to do the same thing<br>with little code and more effectively!<br>11.Updates to this specification that may be posted on piazza are also part of this<br>specification.<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>5. Grading Scheme<br>Item  Grade<br>Correctness of your code  90<br>Code Style (indentation) &amp;<br>Implementation Comments in a2.cpp<br>10<br>TOTAL  100<br>6. Submission<br>Submit ​ONLY your a2.cpp​​ file at the following location:<br>/p/course/cs368-gerald/public/handin/<cslogin>/a2<br>Remember that ​no late work is accepted​​ in this course and there are no exceptions!<br>Hope you have a great time learning and coding associative containers and<br>algorithms using the C++ Standard Library! :)<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br><br><br><br></cslogin></reviewsfile></reviewratingsfile></string,></review></rating></font>

Important Details<br>1. The code for this assignment is split across 5 files.<br>a. main.cpp<br>b. a2.hpp<br>c. a2.cpp​ (This is the ONLY file you should modify!)<br>d. trim.hpp<br>e. trim.cpp<br>The .hpp files are the header files which contain only the declaration of the functions and<br>the .cpp files are the source files which contain the implementation of these functions. If<br>you want to understand more about why we have separate header and source files, then<br>maybe you should read ​this​.<br>2. Take some time to read the source code starting from the main() function that is present<br>inside the file main.cpp.<br>3. All the code you write for this assignment will only be inside the file ​a2.cpp. You should<br>not perform any file IO, print to stdout, or print to stderr in a2.cpp.<br>4. The files trim.hpp and trim.cpp are provided only to help you with trimming the<br>whitespaces in strings since doing so in C++ is not so easy as it’s in Java. You may read<br>these files to find out how to trim strings for this assignment.<br>5. You should use the following command to ​compile​​ your program.<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>$ g++ <em>.cpp -std=c++11<br>where </em>.cpp means all the .cpp files are to be compiled. You need not mention the<br>names of the .hpp files since they are included from within the .cpp files. The option<br>“-std=c++11” informs the compiler that our may contain C++11 features (e.g.<br>std::unordered_map was introduced only in C++11).<br>6. Your program takes the two files ​rawReviewRatings.txt and ​rawReviews.txt as ​command<br>line arguments​. ​​You should run your program as shown below:<br>$ ./a.out rawReviewRatings.txt rawReviews.txt<br>If you don’t give these 2 command line arguments to your program, then the following<br>error message will be printed. This error handling is already handled for you in main.cpp.<br>$ ./a.out<br>USAGE: ./a.out <reviewratingsfile> <reviewsfile><br>7. If your program works correctly without any errors, then nothing is printed to the console.<br>Only the three output files cleanReviewRatings.txt, cleanReviews.txt and ratings.txt will<br>be produced. You may even try compiling and running your program before adding any<br>code in a2.cpp to see if these 3 output files are produced. The contents of these output<br>files will be empty until the methods in a2.cpp are implemented.<br>8. You should NOT add any new functions/methods in a2.cpp.<br>9. You ​SHOULD NOT MODIFY​​ any of the following in a2.cpp:<br>a. Names of the functions<br>b. Names and types of the parameters to a function.<br>c. Return types of the functions.<br>10.An approximate number of lines of code is given for each function in a2.cpp. These are<br>the number of lines for each function in Gerald’s implementation of a2.cpp. We have<br>provided this information since it may help you to see how little code you may write if you<br>make use of the C++ Standard Library effectively. This would help you to stop and think<br>for a while before you may write a lot of code by yourself and maybe later realize that<br>you could have used some functionality from the standard library to do the same thing<br>with little code and more effectively!<br>11.Updates to this specification that may be posted on piazza are also part of this<br>specification.<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>5.

Heavy penalties will<br>apply for late submission. This is an individual assignment and must be entirely your own work. You must<br>attribute the source of any part of your code which you have not written yourself. Please note the section on<br>plagiarism in this document.<br>The assignment must be done using the BlueJ environment. All user input to the system, and system<br>output to the user, must be done at the BlueJ terminal window. No other graphical interfaces are to be<br>used (nor assessed) in your program.<br>The Java source code for this assignment must be implemented according to the FIT9131 Java Coding<br>Standards.<br>Any points needing clarification should be discussed with your tutor in the tutorial class. You should not<br>make any assumptions about the program without consulting with your tutor.<br>Specification<br>For this assignment you are required to write a program that implements a simple Student Management<br>System for a very small, fictional, school. This section specifies the required functionality of the program.<br>The aim of the Student Management System is for a user (the school’s enrolment staff) to keep a database of<br>the students enrolled in various subjects in this fictional school. This school only offers three (3) subjects :<br>Computing, Maths, and English. The system will allow the user to add/delete students, enrol them in<br>subjects, and perform simple reports.<br>Even though this program is functionally very different from the program you wrote in Assignment 1, you<br>should be able to re-use much of your previous code here - if you have designed the classes/logic in your<br>previous program properly. This is one of the major benefits of an object-oriented program - the ability to<br>re-use classes.<br>The Student Management System should provide the following features :<br> maintains a list (using a Java Collection class) of Student objects<br>o each Student object represents a person who is allowed to enrol in the fictional school<br> maintains a fixed list of exactly 3 Subject objects<br>o each Subject object represents a subject which is available in the fictional school<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 2<br> enrol each student in a subject, or subjects (HD level)<br> lists the details of an existing student<br> produces a report of students based on some criteria<br> loads a list of students (with their enrolled subjects) from a text file<br> saves the list of current students (with their enrolled subjects) to a text file<br>You are to demonstrate the following programming techniques in your program :<br> reading/writing data from/to text files<br> using appropriate Java Collection class or classes to store data<br> using code to manipulate the data in the collection(s)<br> performing simple searches, filtered by some given criteria<br> using program constructs such as repetitions &amp; selections<br> using appropriate classes to represent objects in the program<br>There will be a description of the “HD level” features later in this document (in the Grades section).<br>You are also required to produce a partial Test Strategy for your program.<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 3<br>Program Logic<br>When the Student Management System starts, it should automatically load a text file called<br>“students.txt” which contains details of all students currently stored in the system. The actual format<br>of this text file is described later in this document. The data loaded should be stored in some appropriate data<br>structures. No other reading from or writing to file is required while the program is in operation, until the<br>user chooses to exit, at which point the program saves all the data in memory back to the same text file<br>(students.txt).<br>In other words, the file I/O operations are performed automatically by the program, and require no<br>interactions with the user.<br>When the program is running, it should repeatedly display a menu with these options :<br>(1) Add new student<br>(2) Delete a student<br>(3) Find Student By Name<br>(4) List Students By Subject<br>(5) List All Students<br>(6) Exit System<br>Option (1) allows the user to add a new student into the database. The user should be asked for the student’s<br>details, plus what subject to “enrol” him/her in.<br>Option (2) allows the user to remove an existing student from the database.<br>Option (3) allows the user to find an existing student in the database. The user should be asked to enter a<br>name to search for. If a matching student is found, his/her details will be displayed.<br>Option (4) allows the user to display a list of students enrolled in a subject. The user should be asked for a<br>subject name; a list of all students (if any) enrolled in that subject should then be displayed.<br>Option (5) allows the user to display a list of all students enrolled in the school.<br>Option (6) exits the program. All the students currently in memory are automatically saved to<br>“students.txt”.<br>Inputs other than 1-6 should be rejected, and an error message printed. The menu should be displayed<br>repeatedly, until the user chooses Option (6).<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 4<br>Important Assumptions<br>You should observe the following assumptions when implementing your program :<br> all student names are unique - if a student is already in the database, trying to add the same name<br>again should generate an error<br> there is no limit to how many students can be enrolled<br> exactly 3 subjects are offered : Computing, Maths and English<br> each student can only enrol in exactly one subject<br> all searches use exact matches (eg. “andy” will not match “andy cheng”); however, the search<br>strings are not case-sensitive (eg. “Sue Smith” is considered to be the same as “SUE smith”)<br> the data file is always in the correct format - ie. no need to validate the data when reading it in<br>Student Record Format<br>Each student in the database contains the following information :<br> Name (non-blank String, may contain multiple words)<br> Telephone (non-blank String, exactly 9 digits, 1st digit must be a ‘9’)<br> Subject (a String, representing one of the 3 subjects offered)<br>Input File Format<br>The input data file (students.txt) has the following format for each line :<br>Name,Telephone,Subject  (the fields are separated by commas)<br>Eg.<br>David Smith,912345678,Maths<br>Andy Cheng,987654321,Computing<br>Susan Dally,911221122,English<br>Zak Whatever,999999999,Maths<br>Russell Crowe,980808080,Computing<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 5<br>Program Design<br>Your program must demonstrate your understanding of the object-oriented concepts and general<br>programming constructs presented in FIT9131. You must use appropriate data structures to store the various<br>objects (list of students, list of subjects, etc) in the program.<br>You must be able to justify the choice of the data structures during your interview. You must document any<br>additional assumptions you made.<br>Validation of values for fields and local variables should also be implemented. You should not allow an<br>object of a class to be set to an invalid state.<br>Discuss with your tutor regarding what classes are appropriate, and how they interact with each other.<br>The main requirements are : (1) the Students and Subjects must be implemented as objects, and they must<br>be stored in some appropriate Java collections, and (2) for the HD level , the list of Subjects within each<br>Student object must also be stored in some appropriate Java collections.<br>Your program must deal with invalid values entered by the user in a sensible manner. For instance, if a user<br>enters “abc” instead of a number for the menu options, your program should not crash.<br>All on-screen input/output should be formatted in a user-friendly manner. Sensible error messages should be<br>displayed whenever appropriate (eg. when searching for a student who is not in the database, trying to enrol<br>student in a subject which does not exist, etc).<br>Grades<br>There are 2 possible Grade Categories for this assignment, as described below :<br>1) A maximum grade of up to a D (Distinction) can be achieved by correctly implementing all the<br>features as described in the “Program Logic” section above.<br>2) To achieve up to a maximum of a HD (High Distinction), you need to implement the following<br>additional features :<br> for Option (1), a student can be enrolled in up to a maximum of 3 unique subjects<br> for Option (4), the user can specify more than 1 subject, and the program will display all<br>students listed in those subjects (eg. all students enrolled in both “Computing” AND “English”,<br>all students enrolled in “Computing” AND “Maths” AND “English”, etc)<br>Note : The description of the program’s logic/design is intentionally left vague, to give you some room<br>to exercise your own design and creativity. Discuss with your tutor about what/how to implement.<br>Important : You must not attempt the HD Category until you have fully implemented the D<br>Category. If you submit a program which partially implements both, you will only be awarded up<br>to a maximum of D.<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 6<br>Test Strategy<br>For this assignment, you are required to produce a partial Test Strategy for the program.<br>There is no need to produce Test Strategy for any other classes you have used in your program.<br>You must provide a Test Plan, plus detailed sets of Test Data, Expected Results and Actual Results for the<br>Student class.<br>Assessment<br>Assessment for this assignment will be done via an interview with your tutor. The marks will be allocated as<br>follows:<br> Test Strategy : 10%<br> Java Code &amp; Object-Oriented Design : 35%<br> Program Functionality in accordance with the requirements : 55%<br>You must submit your work by the submission deadline on the due date (a late penalty of 20% per day of<br>the possible marks will apply).<br>Marks will be deducted for untidy submissions and non-conformances to the FIT9131 Java Coding<br>Standards.<br>Interview<br>You will be asked to demonstrate your program at an interview following the submission date. At the<br>interview you can also expect to be asked to explain your code, your design, discuss design decisions and<br>alternatives and modify your code as required. Marks will not be awarded for any section of code or<br>functionality that a student cannot explain satisfactorily. (The marker may delete excessive comments in<br>code before a student is asked to explain that code).<br>In other words, you will be assessed on your understanding of the code, and not on the actual code itself.<br>Interview times will be arranged in the tutorial labs in Week 12. It is your responsibility to attend the lab and<br>arrange an interview time with your tutor. Any student who does not attend an interview will receive a mark<br>of 0 for the assignment.<br>The actual interviews will take place in Week 13.<br>Your Test Strategy will be only for one class - the Student class.<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 7<br>Submission Requirements<br>The assignment must be uploaded to Moodle on or before the due date. The link to upload the assignment<br>will be made available in the Assignments section of the unit’s Moodle site before the submission deadline.<br>The submission requirements are as follows:<br>A .zip file uploaded to Moodle containing the following components:<br> the BlueJ project you created to implement your assignment. The .zip should be named with your<br>Student ID Number. For example, if your id is 12345678, then the file should be named<br>12345678_A2.zip. Do not name your file any other way.<br> it is your responsibility to check that your ZIP file contains all the correct files, and is not corrupted,<br>before you submit it. If you tutor cannot open your zip file, or if it does not contain the correct files,<br>you will not be assessed.<br> an MS Word document containing your Test Strategy for the Student class.  (Note: The JUnit facility in<br>BlueJ is NOT to be used for this assignment)<br> a completed Assignment Cover Sheet. This will be available for download from the unit’s Moodle site<br>before the submission deadline. You simply complete the editable sections of the document, save it, and<br>include it in your .zip file for submission.<br>Marks will be deducted for failure to comply with any of these requirements.<br>Warning : there will be no extensions to the due date. Any late submission will incur the 20% per day<br>penalty. It is strongly suggested that you submit the assignment well before the deadline, in case there are<br>some unexpected complications on the day (eg. interruptions to your home internet connection).<br>Plagiarism<br>Cheating and plagiarism are viewed as serious offences. In cases where cheating has been confirmed,<br>students have been severely penalised, from losing all marks for an assignment, to facing disciplinary action<br>at the Faculty level. Monash has several policies in relation to these offences and it is your responsibility to<br>acquaint yourself with these.<br>Plagiarism (<a href="http://www.policy.monash.edu/policybank/academic/education/conduct/plagiarism-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.policy.monash.edu/policybank/academic/education/conduct/plagiarism-policy.html</a>)<br>Discipline: Student Policy (<a href="http://www.policy.monash.edu/policy-" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.policy.monash.edu/policy-</a><br>bank/academic/education/conduct/student-discipline-policy.html<br><br><br></font>

Change Log<br>Version 1.0 released on 19 th September 2016.<br>2. Goal and Learning Objectives<br>In this assignment your task is to implement the link state routing protocol. Your program will be<br>running at all nodes in the specified network. At each node the input to your program is a set of<br>directly attached nodes (i.e. neighbours) and the costs of these links. Each node will broadcast<br>link-state packets to all other nodes in the network. Your routing program at each node should<br>report the least-cost path and the associated cost to all other nodes in the network. Your program<br>should be able to deal with failed nodes.<br>2.1 Learning Objectives<br>On completing this assignment you will gain sufficient expertise in the following skills:<br>• Designing a routing protocol<br>• Link state (Dijkstra’s) algorithm<br>• UDP socket programming<br>• Handling routing dynamics<br>3. Assignment Specification<br>This section gives detailed specifications of the assignment. You can receive 1 bonus mark for<br>submitting the assignment 1 week prior to the deadline.<br>3.1 Implementation Details<br>In this assignment, you will implement the link state routing protocol.<br>The program will accept the following command line arguments:<br>• NODE_ID, the ID for this node. This argument must be a single uppercase alphabet (e.g., A,<br>B, etc).<br>• NODE_PORT, the port number on which this node will send and receive packets to and from<br>its neighbours.<br>Updates to the assignment, including any corrections and clarifications, will be posted on the<br>subject website. Please make sure that you check the subject website regularly for updates.<br>• CONFIG.TXT, this file will contain the costs to the neighbouring nodes. It will also contain<br>the port number being used by each neighbour for exchanging routing packets. An example of<br>this file is provided below.<br>Since we can’t let you play with real network routers, the routing programs for all the nodes in the<br>simulated network will run on a single desktop machine. However, each instance of the routing<br>protocol (corresponding to each node in the network) will be listening on a different port number.<br>If your routing software executes correctly on a single desktop machine, it should also work<br>correctly on real network routers. Note that, the terms router and node are used interchangeably in<br>the rest of this specification.<br>Assume that the routing protocol is being instantiated for a node A, with two neighbours B and C.<br>A simple example of how the routing program would be executed (assuming it is a Java program<br>named Lsr.java) follows:<br>java Lsr A 2000 config.txt<br>where the config.txt would be as follows:<br>2<br>B 5 2001<br>C 7 2002<br>The first line of this file indicates the number of neighbours (NOT the total number of nodes in the<br>network). Following this there is one line dedicated to each neighbour. It starts with the neighbour<br>id, followed by the cost to reach this neighbour and finally the port number that this neighbour is<br>using for communication. For example, the second line in the config.txt above indicates that the<br>cost to neighbour B is 5 and this neighbour is using port number 2001 for receiving and<br>transmitting link-state packets. The node ids will be uppercase alphabets and you can assume that<br>there will be no more than 10 nodes in the test scenarios. However, do not make assumptions that<br>the node ids will necessarily start from the letter A or that they will always be in sequence. The<br>link costs should be floating point numbers (up to the first decimal) and the port numbers should<br>be integers. These three fields will be separated by a single white space between two successive<br>fields in each line of the configuration file. The link costs will be static and will not change once<br>initialised. Further, the link costs will be consistent in both directions, i.e., if the cost from A to B<br>is 5, then the link from B to A will also have a cost of 5. You may assume that the configuration<br>files used for marking will be consistent with the above description and devoid of any errors.<br>Important: It is worth restating that initially each node is only aware of the costs to its direct<br>neighbours. The nodes do not have global knowledge (i.e. information about the entire network<br>topology) at start-up.<br>The remainder of the specification is divided into two parts, beginning with the base specification<br>as the first part and the subsequent part adding new functionality to the base specification. In order<br>to receive full marks for this assignment you must implement both parts. If you are unable to<br>complete the second part, you will still receive marks for the first part. (The marking guidelines at<br>the end of the specification indicate the distribution of marks).<br>Part 1: Base Specification<br>In link-state routing, each node broadcasts link-state packets to all other nodes in the network, with<br>each link-state packet containing the identities of the node’s neighbours and the associated costs to<br>reach them. You must implement a simple broadcasting mechanism in your program. Upon<br>initialisation, each node creates a link-state packet (containing the appropriate information – see<br>description of link-state protocol in the textbook/lecture notes) and sends this packet to all direct<br>neighbours. The exact format of the link-state packets that you will use is left for you to decide.<br>Upon receiving this link-state packet, each neighbouring router in turn broadcasts this packet to its<br>own neighbours (excluding the router from which it received this link-state packet in the first<br>place). This simple flooding mechanism will ensure that each link-state packet is propagated<br>through the entire network.<br>It is possible that some nodes may start earlier than their neighbours. As a result, a node might<br>send the link-state packet to a neighbour, which has not run yet. You should not worry about this<br>since the routing program at each node will repeatedly send the link-state packet to its neighbours<br>and a slow-starting neighbour will eventually get the information. That said, when we test your<br>assignment, we would ensure that all nodes are initiated simultaneously (using a script).<br>Each node should periodically broadcast the link-state packet to its neighbours every<br>UPDATE_INTERVAL. You should set this interval to 1 second. In other words, a node should<br>broadcast a link state packet every second.<br>Real routing protocols use UDP for exchanging control packets. Hence, you MUST use UDP as<br>the transport protocol for exchanging link-state packets amongst the neighbours. Note that, each<br>router can consult its configuration file to determine the port numbers used by its neighbours for<br>exchanging link-state packets. Do not worry about the unreliable nature of UDP. Since, you are<br>simulating multiple routers on a single machine, it is highly unlikely that link-state packets will be<br>dropped. Furthermore, since link-state packets are broadcast periodically, occasional packet loss<br>will not impact the operation of your protocol. If you use TCP, a significant penalty will be<br>assessed.<br>On receiving link-state packets from all other nodes, a router can build up a global view of the<br>network topology. You may want to review your class notes and consult standard data structures<br>textbooks for standard representations of undirected graphs, which would be an appropriate way to<br>model this view of the network.<br>Given a view of the entire network topology, a router should run Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute<br>least-cost paths to all other routers within the network. Each node should wait for a<br>ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL (the default value is 30 seconds) since start-up and then execute<br>Dijkstra’s algorithm. Given that there will be no more than 10 nodes in the network and a periodic<br>link-state broadcast frequency of 1 second, 30 seconds is a sufficiently long duration for each node<br>to discover the global view of the entire topology.<br>Once a router finishes running Dijkstra’s algorithm, it should print out to the terminal, the least-<br>cost path to each destination node (excluding itself) along with the cost of this path. The following<br>is an example output for node A in some arbitrary network:<br>least-cost path to node B: ACB and the cost is 10<br>least-cost path to node C: AC and the cost is 2.5<br>We will wait for duration of ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL after running your program for the<br>output to appear (some extra time will be added as a buffer). If the output does not appear within<br>this time, you will be heavily penalised. As indicated earlier, we will restrict the size of the<br>network to 10 nodes in the test topologies. The default value of 30 seconds is sufficiently long for<br>all the nodes to receive link-state packets from every other node and compute the least-cost paths.<br>Your program should execute forever (as a loop). In other words, each node should keep<br>broadcasting link-state packets every UPDATE_INTERVAL and Dijkstra’s algorithm should be<br>executed and the output printed out every ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL. To kill an instance of<br>the routing protocol, the user should type CTRL-C at the respective terminal.<br>Restricting Link-state Broadcasts: Note that, a naïve broadcast strategy; wherein each node<br>retransmits every link state packet that it receives will result in unnecessary broadcasts and thus<br>increase the overhead. To elaborate this issue, consider the example topology discussed in the<br>latter part of the spec. The link-state packet created by node A will be sent to its direct neighbours<br>B, C and D. Each of these three nodes will in turn broadcast this link-state packet to their<br>neighbours. Let us consider Node C, which broadcasts A’s link state packet to B, D, E and F. Note<br>that node B has already broadcast A’s link state packet once (when it received it directly from A).<br>Node B has now received this same link-state packet via node C. There should thus be no need for<br>node B to broadcast this packet again. You MUST implement a mechanism to reduce such<br>unnecessary broadcasts. This can be achieved in several ways. You are open to choose any method<br>to achieve this. You must describe your method in the written report.<br>Part 2: Dealing with Node Failures<br>In this part you must implement additional functionality in your code to deal with random node<br>failures. Recall that in the base assignment specification it is assumed that once all nodes are up<br>and running they will continue to be operational till the end when all nodes are terminated<br>simultaneously. In this part you must ensure that your algorithm is robust to node failures. Once a<br>node fails, its neighbours must quickly be able to detect this and the corresponding links to this<br>failed node must be removed. Further, the routing protocol should converge and the failed nodes<br>should be excluded from the least-cost path computations. The other nodes should no longer<br>compute least-cost paths to the failed nodes. Furthermore, the failed nodes should not be included<br>in the least-cost paths to other nodes.<br>A simple method that is often used to detect node failures is the use of periodic heartbeat (also<br>often known as keep alive) messages. A heartbeat message is a short control message, which is<br>periodically sent by a node to its directly connected neighbours. If a node does not receive a<br>certain number of consecutive hearbeat messages from one of its neighbours it can assume that<br>this node has failed. Note that, each node transmits a link-state packet to its immediate neighbour<br>every UPDATE_INTERVAL (1 second). Hence, this distance vector message could also double<br>up as the hearbeat message. Alternately, you may wish to make use of an explicit heartbeat<br>message (over UDP), which is transmitted more frequently (i.e. with a period less than 1 second)<br>to expedite the detection of a failed node. It is recommended that you wait till at least 3 consequent<br>hearbeat (or link-state) messages are not received from a neighbour before considering it to have<br>failed. This will ensure that if at all a UDP packet is lost then it does not hamper the operation of<br>your protocol.<br>Once a node has detected that one of its neighbours has failed, it should update its link-state packet<br>accordingly to reflect the change in the local topology. Eventually, via the propagation of the<br>updated link-state packets, other nodes in the network will become aware that the failed node is<br>unreachable and it will be excluded from the link-state computations (i.e. Dijkstra’s algorithm).<br>Once a node has failed, you may assume that it cannot be initialised again.<br>While marking, we will only fail a few nodes, so that a reasonable connected topology is still<br>maintained. Furthermore, care will be taken to ensure that the network does not get partitioned. In<br>a typical topology (recall that the largest topology used for testing will consist of 10 nodes), at<br>most 3 nodes will fail. However, note that the nodes do not have to fail simultaneously.<br>Recall  that  each  node  will  execute  Dijkstra’s  algorithm  periodically  after<br>ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL (30 seconds) to compute the least-cost path to every other<br>destination. It may so happen that the updated link-state packets following a node failure may not<br>have reached certain nodes in the network before this interval expires. As a result, these nodes will<br>use the old topology information (prior to node failure) to compute the least-cost paths. Thus the<br>output at these nodes will be incorrect. This is not an error. It is just an artefact of the delay<br>incurred in propagating the updated link-state information. To account for this, it is necessary to<br>wait for at least two consecutive ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL periods (i.e. 1 minute) after the<br>node failure is initiated. This will ensure that all the nodes are aware of the topology change.<br>While marking, we will wait for 2<em>ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL following a node failure<br>before checking the output.<br>3.2. An Example<br>Let us look at an example with the network topology as shown in the figure below:<br>The numbers alongside the links indicate the link costs. The configuration files for the 6 nodes are<br>available for download from the assignment webpage. In the configuration files we have assumed<br>the following port assignments: A at 2000, B at 2001, C at 2002, D at 2003, E at 2004 and F at<br>2005. However note that some of these ports may be in use by another student logged on to the<br>same CSE machine as you. In this case, change the port assignments in all the configuration files<br>appropriately. The program output at node A should look like the following:<br>least-cost path to node B: AB and the cost is 2.0<br>least-cost path to node C: ADEC and the cost is 3.0<br>least-cost path to node D: AD and the cost is 1.0<br>least-cost path to node E: ADE and the cost is 2.0<br>least-cost path to node F: ADEF and the cost is 4.0<br>Note: It is not necessary that your program should print the paths to the destinations in<br>alphabetical order.<br>You may also test out the ability of your program to deal with node failures in the above example<br>by causing node B to fail (as an example).<br>Please ensure that before you submit, your program provides a similar output for the above<br>topology. However, we will use different network topologies in our testing.<br>4. Additional Notes<br>This is not a group assignment. You are expected to work on this individually.<br>How to start: Sample UDP client and server programs are available on the Week 3 lecture<br>material page. They are a good starting point to start your development. You will also find several<br>links to network programming resources on that page.<br>A<br>D<br>B  C<br>E<br>F<br>2<br>2<br>5<br>1<br>1<br>1<br>3<br>2<br>5<br>3<br>Language and Platform: You are free to use one of C, JAVA or Python to implement this<br>assignment. Please choose a language that you are comfortable with. The programs will be tested<br>on CSE Linux machines. So please make sure that your entire application runs correctly on these<br>machines. This is especially important if you plan to develop and test the programs on your<br>personal computers (which may possibly use a different OS or version or JVM). Note that CSE<br>machines support the following: gcc version 4.9.2, Java 1.7, Python 2.7, 2.8 and 3. Note for<br>Python: In your report, please indicate which version of Python you have used. You may only use<br>the basic socket programming APIs providing in your programming language of choice. Note that,<br>the network will be simulated by running multiple instances of your program on the same machine<br>with a different port number for each node. Make sure that your program will work appropriately<br>under these conditions. See the sequence of operations listed below for details.<br>Error Condition: Note that all the arguments supplied to the programs will be in the appropriate<br>format. The configuration files supplied as an argument to each node will also be consistent with<br>the test topology. Your programs do not have to handle errors in format, etc.<br>You should be aware that port ID’s, when bound to sockets, are system-wide values and thus other<br>students may be using the port number you are trying to use. On Linux systems, you can run the<br>command netstat to see which port numbers are currently assigned.<br>Do not worry about the reliability of UDP in your assignment. It is possible for packets to be<br>dropped, for example, but the chances of problems occurring in a local area network are fairly<br>small. If it does happen on the rare occasion, that is fine. Further, your routing protocol is<br>inherently robust against occasional losses since the link state packets are exchanged every 1<br>second. If your program appears to be losing or corrupting packets on a regular basis, then there is<br>likely a fault in your program.<br>Test your assignment out with several different topologies (besides the sample topology provided).<br>Make sure that your program is robust to node failures by creating several failed nodes (however<br>make sure that the topology is still connected). You can very easily work out the least-cost paths<br>manually (as shown in the lecture notes or the textbook) to verify the output of your program.<br>5. File Naming Convention and Assignment Submission<br>Your main program should be named Lsr.c (or Lsr.java or Lsr.py). You may of course have<br>additional header files and/or helper files. If you are using C you MUST submit a makefile/script<br>(not necessary with Java and Python). In addition you should submit a small report, report.pdf<br>(no more than 3 pages) describing the program design and a brief description of how your system<br>works. Describe the data structure used to represent the network topology and the link-state packet<br>format. Comment on how your program deals with node failures and restricts excessive link-state<br>broadcasts. Also discuss any design tradeoffs considered and made. Describe possible<br>improvements and extensions to your program and indicate how you could realise them. If your<br>program does not work under any particular circumstances please report this here. Also indicate<br>any segments of code that you have borrowed from the Web or other books.<br>You do not have to submit any topology files.<br>Here are the step-by-step instructions for submission:<br>1. Log in to your CSE account.<br>2. Create a directory called assign and copy ONLY the necessary files into that directory.<br>3. Tar this directory using the following command: “tar –cvf assign.tar assign”<br>4. Submit your assignment using the following command: “give cs3331 assign2 assign.tar”. You<br>should receive a confirmation of your submission.<br>Alternately, you may submit the tar archive via the submission link at the top of the assignment<br>web page.<br>Note that, the system will only accept assign.tar as the file name. All other names will be rejected.<br>You can submit as many times as you like before the deadline. A later submission will override<br>the previous submission, so make sure you submit the correct version. Do not wait till just before<br>the deadline for submission, as there may be unforeseen problems (brief disconnection of Internet<br>connectivity, power outage, computer crash, etc.).<br>Late Submission Penalty: Late penalty will be applied as follows:<br>• 1 day after deadline: 10% reduction<br>• 2 days after deadline: 20% reduction<br>• 3 days after deadline: 30% reduction<br>• 4 days after deadline: 40% reduction<br>• 5 or more days late: NOT accepted<br>NOTE: The above penalty is applied to your final total. For example, if you submit your<br>assignment 2 days late and your score on the assignment is 10, then your final mark will be 10 – 2<br>(20% penalty) = 8.<br>6. Plagiarism<br>You are to write all of the code for this assignment yourself. All source codes are subject to strict<br>checks for plagiarism, via highly sophisticated plagiarism detection software. These checks may<br>include comparison with available code from Internet sites and assignments from previous<br>semesters. In addition, each submission will be checked against all other submissions of the<br>current semester. Do not post this assignment on forums where you can pay programmers to write<br>code for you. We will be monitoring such forums. Please note that we take this matter quite<br>seriously. The LIC will decide on appropriate penalty for detected cases of plagiarism. The most<br>likely penalty would be to reduce the assignment mark to ZERO.<br>That said, we are aware that a lot of learning takes place in student conversations, and don’t wish<br>to discourage you from taking your classmates, provided you follow the Gilligan’s Island Rule -<br>After a joint discussion of an assignment or problem, each student should discard all written<br>material and then go do something mind-numbing for half an hour. For example, go watch an<br>episode of Gilligan’s Island (or Reality TV in modern terms), and then recreate the solutions. The<br>idea of this policy is to ensure that you fully understand the solutions or ideas that the group came<br>up with.<br>It is important, for both those helping others and those being helped, not to provide/accept any<br>programming language code in writing, as this is apt to be used exactly as is, and lead to<br>plagiarism penalties for both the supplier and the copier of the codes. Write something on a piece<br>of paper, by all means, but tear it up/take it away when the discussion is over. It is OK to borrow<br>bits and pieces of code from sample socket code out on the Web and in books. You MUST<br>however acknowledge the source of any borrowed code. This means providing a reference to a<br>book or a URL when the code appears (as comments). Also indicate in your report the portions of<br>your code that were borrowed. Explain any modifications you have made (if any) to the borrowed<br>code.<br>7. Forum Use<br>Students are strongly recommended to discuss about the assignment on the course forum.<br>However, at no point should any code fragments be posted to the message forum. Such actions<br>will be considered to be instances of plagiarism, thus incurring a significant penalty. Students are<br>also encouraged to share example topologies that they have created to test their program.<br>8. Sequence of Operation for Testing<br>The following shows the sequence of events that will be involved in the testing of your<br>assignment. Please ensure that before you submit your code you thoroughly check that your code<br>can execute these operations successfully.<br>1) First chose an arbitrary network topology (similar to the test topology above). Create the<br>appropriate configuration files that need to be input to the nodes. Note again that the<br>configuration files should only contain information about the neighbours and not of the entire<br>topology. Work out the least-cost paths and corresponding costs from each node to all other<br>destinations manually using Dijkstra’s algorithm as described in the lecture notes (or<br>textbook). This will allow you to check that your program is computing the paths correctly.<br>2) Log on to a CSE Linux machine. Open as many terminal windows as the number of nodes in<br>your test topology. Almost simultaneously, execute the routing protocol for each node (one<br>node in each terminal).<br>java lsr A 2000 configA.txt (for JAVA)<br>java lsr B 2001 configB.txt<br>and so on. You may write a simple script to automate this process.<br>3) Wait till the nodes display the output at their respective terminals.<br>4) Compare the displayed paths and costs to the ones obtained in step 1 above. These should be<br>consistent.<br>5) The next step involves testing the capability of your program to deal with failed nodes. For this<br>choose a few nodes (max of 3 nodes) from the topology that is currently being tested (in the<br>above tests) and terminate the nodes by typing CTRL-C in their respective terminal windows.<br>Make sure that the nodes chosen for termination do not partition the network. Work out the<br>least-cost paths from each node to all other destinations manually using Dijkstra’s algorithm as<br>described  in  the  lecture  notes  (or  textbook).  Wait  for  a  duration  of<br>2</em>ROUTE_UPDATE_INTERVAL and observe the updated output at each node. Corroborate<br>the results with the manual computations.<br>6) Terminate all nodes.<br>NOTE: We will ensure that your programs are tested multiple times to account for any possible<br>UDP segment losses (it is quite unlikely that your routing packets will be dropped).<br>9. Marking Policy:<br>We will test your routing protocol for at least 2 different network topologies (which will be<br>distinct from the example provided). Marks will be deducted if necessary, depending on the extent<br>of the errors observed in the output at each node. After the marking process we will upload the test<br>topologies on the website for all students to view.<br>Your code will be marked using the following criteria:<br>• Mechanism to restrict link-state broadcasts: 1 marks<br>• Correct operation of the link state protocol: 5.5 marks<br>• Appropriate handling of dead nodes, whereby the least-cost paths are updated to reflect the<br>change in topology: 2.5 marks<br>• Report: 1 mark<br>Bonus Mark: You may receive 1 bonus mark for submitting the assignment a week before the<br>deadline, i.e. by 21 st October 2016 (Week 12). However, to receive the bonus mark, in addition<br>to submitting by the early deadline, your code should have scored at least 7 marks (out of 10) as<br>per the above criteria. The bonus mark can be used to offset lost marks in any assessable<br>component in this course (e.g. mid-semester exam, final exam, labs, etc.).<br>IMPORTANT NOTE: For assignments that fail to execute all of the above tests, we will be<br>unable to award you a substantial mark. Note that, we will test your code multiple times before<br>concluding that there is a problem. You should test your program rigorously and verify the results<br>by trying out different topologies before submitting your code.<br><br><br><br></font>
