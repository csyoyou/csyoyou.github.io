        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>中级难度<br><br>需要完成2个程序，第一个是不带gui界面的，判断字符串是否是回文，判断方法就是首尾循环是否相等，<br>第二个是完成一个旋转车轮的游戏，带gui界面，最后判断谁赢得胜利<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>Programming Assignment 7 ( 100 Points )<br>Due: 11:59pm Thursday, November 10th<br>README ( 10 points )<br>You are required to provide a text file named README, NOT Readme.txt, README.pdf, or<br>README.doc, with your assignment in your pa7 directory. There should be no file extension after the file name<br>“README”. Your README should include the following sections:<br>Program Descriptions ( 5 points ) : Provide a high level description of what each of your programs do and<br>how you can interact with them. Make this explanation such that your grandpa or uncle or someone you know<br>who has no programming experience can understand what these programs do and how to use them. Do not<br>assume your reader is a computer science major.<br>Short Response ( 5 points ) : Answer the following questions:<br>Vim Questions:<br>1. In vim/gvim, what commands will indent N consecutive lines (starting from the cursor line) by one level<br>where the indent level is defined to be two spaces? This will take two vim commands: one to set the<br>number of spaces to indent with each indent level (default is 8), and one to actually indent N<br>consecutive lines. Likewise what command will shift N lines left (de-indent N lines)?<br>2. In vim/gvim, what command will indent an entire curly-bracket block one level, while the cursor is<br>currently on either the open or close curly bracket of the block? Likewise what command will shift an<br>entire curly-bracket block one level left (de-indent block)?<br>3. How do you open a new line below and insert (one keyboard key for both steps)?<br>Unix Question:<br>4. On the Unix command line, how can you capture (redirect) the program’s output into a file named<br>“output”?<br>Java Question:<br>5. How can you create an array of ints in Java and initialize it with the values of all single digit odd positive<br>numbers (inclusively between 0-9), all in one step/line?<br>STYLE ( 20 points )<br>Please see preview programming assignments; especially PA2’s writeup.  You will be specifically graded on<br>commenting, file headers, class and method headers, meaningful variable names, judicious use of blank lines,<br>not having more than 80 characters on a line, perfect indentation, no magic numbers/hard-coded numbers<br>other than -1, 0, +1, using setters and getters, etc (see the style section of PA2’s writeup).<br>You will lose significant points if you have static methods or static variables for the Spin100 program<br>(except, constants are okay). Instead you should create getters and setters to change the variables for an<br>object.<br>CORRECTNESS ( 70 points )<br>Start by creating your pa7 directory as usual. Then copy over the starter code from the public folder by doing<br>the following:<br>$ cp ~/../public/PA7indrome.java ~/pa7<br>$ cp ~/../public/PA7-images/<em> ~/pa7<br>Program 1: PA7indrome ( 20 Points )<br>You must use recursion and implement the methods listed below or you will lose all 20 points for this<br>program. Also,  do not edit the main() method in PA7indrome.java as it will negatively affect your grade.<br>Write a command line application that checks whether an array of strings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a<br>word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same forwards and backwards. The<br>program will take in a file as a command line argument. Each line of the file will be converted into a string,<br>where each string will be placed as an element in an arraylist then converted to an array (this part has already<br>been written for you in the main() method–do not edit anything in this method). Your task will be to then<br>determine if the array of strings is a palindrome or not (non-case sensitive). You will be using two recursive<br>methods to implement this functionality.<br>public static char[] reverse( char[] toRev ) {…}<br>● Overall goal: reverse the array of characters passed in using recursion.<br>● If the length of the character array passed in is 1, just return the array right away.<br>● Otherwise, swap the first and last characters in the array (#1-3 below)<br>● Copy the middle of the array into a new array and recursively call reverse on this new array (#4 below).<br>● Place the returned array back into the middle of the original array of characters, and return this<br>reversed array of characters (#5 below).<br>● Hint: you can use System.arraycopy() (look up the javadocs).<br>● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.<br>public static boolean isPalindrome( String[] words, int lo, int hi ) {…}<br>● Overall goal: determine if the array of strings passed in is a palindrome using recursion.<br>● Determine if the string at the low index in the words array is the reverse of the string at the high index in<br>the words array. To do so, you must use your reverse() function, after converting the string to a char<br>array and passing it in. This comparison should be non-case sensitive.<br>● If the string at the low index is indeed the reverse of the string at the high index, recurse on the<br>remaining middle portion of the array by passing modified values of the low and high index in the<br>recursive call. Otherwise, return false.<br>● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.<br>You must use these methods as they are defined above or you will lose points.<br>We will test for edge cases when grading this assignment, so it is up to you to test your program thoroughly.<br>Similar to previous assignments, your output MUST match exactly to our sample output!<br>Sample Output 1: Not a palindrome (user input in BOLD)<br>For this example, the input file is named notPalindrome. If you open the file in vim, it should look like this:<br>start<br>early<br>start<br>often<br>The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome notPalindrome<br>Input array of strings:<br>start, early, start, often<br>The file is not a palindrome.<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$<br>Sample Output 2: Odd-length palindrome (user input in BOLD)<br>Input file named oddPalindrome:<br>StArT<br>EaRlY<br>sTaRt<br>oFtEn<br>ufotofu<br>NeTfO<br>TrAtS<br>yLrAe<br>tRaTs<br>The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome oddPalindrome<br>Input array of strings:<br>StArT, EaRlY, sTaRt, oFtEn, ufotofu, NeTfO, TrAtS, yLrAe, tRaTs<br>The file is a palindrome.<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$<br>The sequence of characters in the array of Strings generated from the input file reads the same forwards and<br>backwards (non-case sensitive), so it is a palindrome.

Player 1 gets to spin the wheel first. Player 1 gets to<br>spin until they have reached over 100 points or have clicked the “Finish Player 1” button. At that point,<br>it becomes Player 2’s turn. Player 2 then gets to spin until they have reached over 100 points or have<br>clicked the “Finish Player 2” button.<br>● Once Player 2 goes over 100 points or clicks the “Finish Player 2” button, the game ends.<br>● Whichever player is closer to 100 points wins. Once a player goes over 100 points then they’ve lost. If<br>both players go over 100 points then it’s a tie. If both players have the same score, then it’s a tie.<br>Example scores and their outcomes:<br>Player 1  70  120  20  100  100  95<br>Player 2  90  110  120  100  105  100<br>Winner  Player 2  Tie  Player 1  Tie  Player 1  Player 2<br>Implementation Details:<br>This program will have two Java source files: Spin100Controller.java and Spin100Wheel.java.<br>Spin100Controller.java will be the main controller which extends WindowController and handles the GUI<br>layout. Spin100Wheel.java will be the actual wheel object that defines what a wheel can do, how it spins, etc.<br>1. Setting up the GUI:<br>Start by first getting the GUI set up in the begin() method of Spin100Controller.java.<br>The top panel will have 3 labels:<br>● “Spin100” - You can customize the font of this label–don’t worry about whether the font is the default or<br>not! Just make sure your program doesn’t throw errors or have an incorrect layout / text upon start.<br>● “Player 1’s score: “ - followed by player 1’s score (initially 0).<br>● “Player 2’s score: “ - followed by player 2’s score (initially 0).<br>○ Note the space following the ‘:’ for each player’s score<br>The bottom panel will have 5 buttons: (make sure the text matches exactly).<br>● “Click to Spin P1”<br>● “Finish Player 1”<br>● “Restart”<br>● “Click to Spin P2”<br>● “Finish Player 2”<br>The wheels on the center canvas:<br>● The center of the window will have the canvas, similar to PA6. The height and width of the canvas<br>should be 840 x 660. Note that the canvas will not be resized during testing. On the canvas we will<br>be displaying two wheels (one for each player). In order to create the wheels, we need to initialize an<br>array of Image(s), using the images you copied over from the public folder. Make sure your images<br>are directly inside your pa7 directory, and not in a subdirectory called PA7-images.<br>● You will want to load the 20 images into an array of Images. To ensure you arrange the images in the<br>correct order, we suggest creating the following array. This will ensure you load the images in the<br>correct order and will also be helpful for scoring later on. Load the images corresponding to these<br>score values in the order in which they appear in the array. The array of images and the array of score<br>values will be parallel arrays.<br>private static final int[] SCORES = { 50, 85, 30, 65, 10, 45, 70, 25, 90, 5,<br>100, 15, 80, 35, 60, 20, 40, 75, 55, 95 };<br>● The wheel should always start with 50 in the center and should spin in a downward direction. This<br>means that when the wheel spins for the first time, the red arrow will first point to 50, then 85, then 30,<br>and so on.<br>● You will want to create each wheel by calling the Spin100Wheel constructor. Some parameters you will<br>probably want to pass to the constructor are:<br>○ The array of Image(s) corresponding to the SCORES values.<br>○ Location of the wheel (location of the top number). The center of the left wheel should be<br>horizontally aligned with the center of the left half of the canvas. In other words, you need to find<br>the x-coordinate that will center the left wheel in the center of the left half of the canvas.<br>Similarly, you need to find the x-coordinate that will center the right wheel in the center of the<br>right half of the canvas. The y-coordinate of the top number for both wheels should be 10 (make<br>sure the layout of your wheels matches the screenshots exactly).<br>○ Reference to the Spin100Controller so that controller methods can be called from the wheel<br>(this will be useful for setting the score after the wheel stops spinning each time)<br>○ Reference to the drawing canvas so the wheel can be placed on the canvas<br>The red arrows on the center canvas:<br>● The arrows are red-filled arcs with start angle = -15, arc angle = 30, height = 150, and width = 150.<br>● Left arrow position: (234.5, 186.0)<br>● Right arrow position: (688.5, 186.0)<br>Messages declaring winner on the center canvas:<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “Tie” at position (444, 5). The text should be blue, bold, and size 16.<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “P1 Winner” at position (20, 5). The text should be green, bold, and<br>size 16.<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “P2 Winner” at position (808, 5). The text should be green, bold,<br>and size 16.<br>See the screenshot section below to see what all of this looks like.<br>2. Wheel Functionality<br>Because the wheels are animated, the Spin100Wheel class needs to extend ActiveObject (and therefore must<br>contain a run() method).<br>Creating a wheel:<br>● Each wheel needs an array of 5 VisibleImages (generated from the array of images passed in as a<br>parameter to the constructor) to store the 5 images that will be visible on the canvas at any given time.<br>● The location passed to the constructor is the location of the topmost VisibleImage. The next<br>VisibleImage will be 99 pixels below that, and the next 99 pixels below that, and so on.<br>● Each wheel needs a random double generator object to generate random numbers for the amount of<br>ticks to spin when the spin button is clicked (see more details below in the Spinning the wheel section).<br>● Don’t forget to save a reference to the Spin100Controller object to help with scoring.<br>● Set the number of ticks to 0, so the wheel begins stationary.<br>● As with all ActiveObjects, the last statement in the constructor should be start();.<br>Spinning the wheel:<br>● Initially, the wheel’s number of ticks should be set to zero. When a wheel’s spin button is clicked, the<br>controller should update the number of ticks so the wheel will start spinning. This means you will want<br>a method to generate a random number of ticks for the wheel to spin.<br>● One way to implement this is to have a method called getRandomTicks(). This method should:<br>○ First generate a random double between 0 and 1<br>○ Based on the random number, return the minimum number of ticks (50) + a number of<br>additional ticks, which indicates how many ticks a wheel should spin for. This is to allow the<br>wheel to stop on different numbers each time by randomizing where a wheel stops cycling<br>through the array of images.<br>○ If the random number is between 0 and 0.05, return MIN_TICKS + 1. If it’s between .05 and .1,<br>return MIN_TICKS + 2. You should keep adding one more tick until you return MIN_TICKS + 13<br>for when the value is between .6 and .65. From there you should subtract one less tick until you<br>return MIN_TICKS + 6 when the value is between .95 and 1.<br>■ Range of ticks to add (over the .05 increments) is<br>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6)<br>● After getting the random number of ticks, the controller needs to set the wheel’s number of ticks using a<br>setter method.<br>● To make the wheel actually spin, the run method will need to constantly check its number of ticks. If<br>the number of ticks is greater than 0, increment the index of each visible image displayed to the next<br>index in the images array; in other words, for every tick, shift the images down one. Once you reach<br>the last index of the images array, wrap back around to the beginning (Hint: think mod operator).<br>Then decrement the number of ticks left for this wheel to spin and pause to slow down the animation.<br>● At the beginning of each spin, the initial delay should be set to 1. Then when the wheel delay is less<br>than 20, the wheel delay should increment by 1 on every iteration of the forever loop. When the wheel<br>delay is greater than or equal to 20 and less than 200, the wheel delay should increment by 5. When<br>the wheel delay is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 500, the wheel delay should increment by<br>20. This will give the illusion of a faster spin at the start which eventually slows down and stops once<br>the number of ticks is zero.<br>● Once the number of ticks is 0, the wheel needs to call a public method in controller to let the controller<br>know that the wheel’s score has changed and that the Text object for the score needs to be updated.<br>● Some additional methods to include in the class would be setters and getters for the ticks, delay, and<br>score. This is so that the controller can call these methods and change the wheel’s variables’ values<br>when something like the spin, finish, or reset button is pressed.<br>3. Controller Functionality<br>You will implement Spin100Controller.java to handle creating the buttons and listening to actions performed on<br>the buttons.<br>● Upon start, only the “Click to Spin P1” and “Restart” buttons should be enabled. So in your begin()<br>method, in addition to setting up the layouts of the buttons, you should also disable the “Finish Player 1”<br>button and all buttons associated with Player 2.<br>● Once you have clicked “Click to Spin P1”, all buttons are disabled until the wheel stops spinning. Once<br>the wheel stops spinning, update Player 1’s score. Now that you have spun Player 1’s wheel at least<br>once, the “Finish Player 1” button should be enabled.<br>● As long as Player 1’s score is less than or equal to 100, Player 1 can choose to continue spinning by<br>clicking “Click to Spin P1” again, or click “Finish Player 1” to finish their turn. Once Player 1’s score is<br>over 100, the controller will automatically finish the turn for Player 1.<br>● Once Player 1 has finished, all of Player 1’s buttons are disabled and the “Click to Spin P2” button is<br>enabled for Player 2 to start spinning. The spinning process follows the same condition as stated for<br>Player 1.<br>● Once Player 2 has also finished, all but the Restart button should be disabled. A game over message<br>should be displayed. The message could announce a Tie, or announce that either Player 1 or Player 2<br>won (see screenshots for detail).<br>Summary of the buttons<br>● The Spin buttons: The spin button disables itself when:<br>○ The wheels are spinning<br>○ The player’s score has passed 100<br>○ The player has clicked finish after at least one spin<br>● The Finish buttons: Each player’s finish button is disabled until they have spun at least once. It is also<br>disabled when the wheel is spinning, as well as after they have finished their turn.<br>● The Restart button: This button is always enabled except when a wheel is spinning. Once clicked:<br>○ It changes the scores back to 0<br>○ It resets the wheels so that 50 is at the center again<br>○ The “Click To Spin P1” button is enabled again and the buttons are reset to the original state.<br>Implementation Requirements for Button Event Handling<br>To manage the behaviors of the 5 buttons, you must define 5 private member inner classes inside the<br>Spin100Controller class. Use your notes from class as a reference.<br>● Each private class must implement the ActionListener interface.<br>● The ActionListener interface enforces that each class has the actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method<br>declared and implemented.<br>Having separate inner classes for each button is much better than handling all button events in one<br>actionPerformed() method. This is because there is a one-to-one relationship between buttons and listeners,<br>resulting in cleaner code that is less prone to errors.<br>Note: Remember to use getters/setters vs. directly accessing variables by name.<br>4. Sample Screenshots:<br>The start of the program.

Set the canvas width to 1000 and the canvas height to 660.<br>Overall Wins: 1 Point<br>Keep track of the overall wins with a message that appears at the end of the game:<br>Overall Wins P1: #, P2 @<br>where # is a non-negative number indicating how many times player 1 has won the game and @ is a non-<br>negative number indicating how many times player 2 has won the game. This message cannot overlap either<br>wheel and it should be horizontally centered between the wheels. It should be 200 pixels above the vertical<br>center of the canvas. The message can be in whatever color you would like besides black. In the case of a tie,<br>neither player’s win count should change.<br>Change Spin Direction: 1 Point<br>Add some new buttons and change the old ones so that each player has the option to spin up or down. There<br>should be a “P1, Spin Up” button, “P1, Spin Down” button, “P2, Spin Up” button, and “P2, Spin Down” button.<br>To clarify, spinning up is where the numbers appear to be moving up (so the 50 goes towards the top) whereas<br>spinning down is where the numbers appear to be moving down (so the 50 moves towards the bottom). You<br>can see the new buttons in the screenshots below. Disabling the buttons should still work the same as it does<br>in the normal portion of the PA, just make sure to disable both the Up and Down spin buttons.<br>Switch Starting Players: 3 Points<br>The “Switch” button is enabled only at the start of each round of the game. This button should be disabled in<br>the middle of a game (i.e. if a spin has occurred). This allows the player who spins first to switch with the other<br>player. For instance, if Player 1 was going to start first and the switch button is clicked. then the game will<br>restart and Player 2 will now start first. If the restart button were then clicked, Player 2 would still be going first.<br>Sample Screenshots:<br>If all extra credit features are implemented, this is the initial state of the program.<br>The overall number of wins for each player is shown when a round finishes.<br>Player 2 can begin the round of a game when “Switch” is clicked.<br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>中级难度<br><br>完成意大利儿童纸牌游戏的完整版。居于上一次作业的重构和改进，主要游戏的游戏规则，<br>根据规则写相关的操作逻辑，并且完成测试。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>CS1210 Computer Science I: Foundations<br>Homework 5: Ruba Mazzetto, Completed<br>Due Monday, October 31 at 11:59PM<br>Introduction<br>In Homework 4, you completed the simple implementation of the Italian children’s card game called<br>Ruba Mazzetto. In this homework, we’ll finally finish the complete version of the game that pits you<br>against any number of other players, and includes provisions for taking more than one card each turn. In<br>the interest of brevity, you can refer to the descriptions of Homework 3 and Homework 4 for more<br>information about the game.<br>Background<br>For this assignment, we’ll start with a refactored version of the Homework 4 solution, that incorporates<br>one small change to the rules of the game 1 and significantly revamps the structure of the play() function.<br>Your job is to complete this refactored version to support taking more than one card per turn, where the<br>cards matched must sum to the value of the card played. So, for example, the solution to Homework 5 will<br>behave as follows (excerpt taken from the middle of a 3-player game):<br>Pl aye r 0 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 1] 7♠ (<em>3) , [P l aye r 2] 6♥ (</em>2)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦, [4] 3♦<br>My hand : [0] 10♣, [1] 10♠<br>Pl ay wh i ch ca rd? 0<br>Se l ec t ma t ch i ng i nd ece s sepa r a t ed by spa c es (b l ank t o d i sca rd) : 1 4<br>Pl aye r 0 p l ays 10♣ and . . .<br>. . . . t ake s 3♦ f rom t ab l e<br>. . . . s t ea l s p l aye r 1 s t ash 7♠<br>=========<br>Pl aye r 1 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 0] 10♣ (<em>5) , [P l aye r 2] 6♥ (</em>2)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦<br>Pl aye r 1 p l ays 6♦ and . . .<br>. . . . s t ea l s p l aye r 2 s t ash 6♥<br>=========<br>Pl aye r 2 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 0] 10♣ (<em>5) , [P l aye r 1] 6♦ (</em>3)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦<br>Pl aye r 2 add s 1♦ t o t ab l e<br>1<br>The small change referred to here has to do with what happens to the cards that remain on the table at the end<br>of the game. In the ‘‘real’’ version of the game, the last person to match cards from the table or another player’s<br>stash is gifted all of the remaining cards on the table when everyone else has finished playing their cards. This<br>change has been incorporated into the play() function.<br>1 Revised October 24, 2016<br>Note how Player 0 uses the 10♣ to match a 3♦ from the table and the 7♣ from Player 1’s stash (because<br>10 = 3 + 7).<br>As for HW4, to make this homework feasible, you will be provided a code skeleton containing nearly all<br>of the code you will need for the solution. Your assignment is to complete the functions getMove() and<br>pickMove(), but you should begin by studying the code skeleton file carefully.<br>def play(N=2, K=10)<br>The play() function has undergone the most significant reworking since the previous assignment. Aside<br>from an additional variable, which changes the parameters of the deck you play with, the big change is in<br>the main iteration that continues until the deck is exhausted. Previously, this loop was divided into two<br>sections: one for the human player and one for everyone else. The new structure merges these two<br>sections into a single loop and relegates the differentiation of the human player from the computer<br>player(s) to getMove(). The last change to play() involves assignment of any cards remaining on the table<br>to the last player who successfully matched, a job handled by the addition of a variable, last, that is reset<br>each time a player makes a match.<br>def getMove(i, N, H, T, P)<br>The purpose of getMove() has changed significantly from HW4. In HW4, getMove() was to return a<br>single ‘‘best’’ move for a given (automated) player, where each move consisted only of matching a single<br>card from the player’s hand with a single card from the table or the top card from an opposing player’s<br>stash. But now that we permit matching a single card from the player’s hand with the sum of multiple<br>cards from the table or from the top of each opposing player’s stash, we need to generate and then<br>consider the space of all possible legal moves. Each move is represented as (c, M), where c is the index<br>into the player’s hand correspond to the card they will play and M is a list of indeces selected from the<br>table and/or the opposing player’s stashes such that sum(M)≡ H[i][c][0]. If (c, M) is (c,[]), then the<br>move corresponds to discarding c to the table.<br>Your job is to implement helper(c,v, j, M, L) to generate all legal moves, from which one will be<br>selected and returned as the value of getMove(). Let’s examine getMove() more closely:<br>(1)  The first step is to determine if the argument i relates to the human player (i ≡0). If so, then move<br>selection is relegated to pickMove().<br>(2)  The second step invokes the as-yet-unwritten helper function helper(c,v, j, M, L) repeatedly<br>(once for each card held by the current player) to generate the list L of all legal moves.<br>(3)  The third step returns a random card to discard if no legal moves were found.<br>(4)  The final step returns the legal move that maximizes the number of cards captured by the current<br>player (note that other heuristics might be used to make a ‘‘best’’ move selection from the list L of<br>legal moves).<br>The helper() function is a recursive function that constructs the set of legal moves. If you think of the<br>len(T) cards on the table and the up to N − 1 player stashes (excluding the current player’s stash) as<br>defining a space of size 2 len(T)+N−1 , you will need to enumerate the up to this many card combinations by<br>considering possible inclusion or exclusion of each successive card. The arguments to<br>helper(c,v, j, M, L) are designed to help you do so.<br>(1)  The first argument, c, is the index of the card you are trying to match from player i’s hand.<br>(2)  The second argument, v, initially the value of c, represents how many ‘‘points’’ remain to match<br>with the addition of each successive card. When this number reaches 0, you know the cards<br>you’ve selected so far sum to the original value you were trying to match.<br>2 Revised October 24, 2016<br>(3)  The third argument, j, initially 0, is the index of the card you are currently considering adding to<br>the legal move you are construction. On each successive recursive call, you’ll increase j by 1 to<br>indicate you are going to consider the next card, from 0 through N up to N + len(T) − 1. At each<br>recursive step, you will want to explore both adding the jth card to the current legal move or not<br>adding it.<br>(4)  The fourth argument, M, initially [], is the legal move under construction. Each time you elect to<br>include an additional card, you will need to extend M to include that card’s index.<br>(5)  The last argument, L, initially [], is the list of legal moves you have found so far. Each new leg al<br>move you discover should be added to L, and the updated L should be the value returned from<br>helper().<br>def pickMove(i, N, H, T, P)<br>pickMove() is called by getMove() when the first argument i to getMove() corresponds to the human<br>player. pickMove() interacts with the user to obtain a legal move (c, M). Note that pickMove() must<br>guarantee that the move is both legal in every sense and that the cards selected from the table and the top<br>of any opposing player’s stash do, in fact, sum to the value of the card selected from the player’s hand.<br>The Ground Rules<br>Because this class is part of the NSF study we have previously described to you, the ground rules may<br>differ slightly section by section. In your section, you will start working on your assignment in discussion<br>section and continue working on it in next week’s discussion section. We ask that you upload a partial<br>solution to ICON at the end of each session (this will not be graded, it is just to see how far you get during<br>the discussion section). You will also be asked to answer a short survey about your experience after each<br>discussion section. Once you upload your final solution to ICON (when the assignment is complete),<br>your will be asked to fill out a separate short survey about your work on the assignment.<br>Just as a reminder, under no circumstances should you turn in the work of someone else (including any<br>code or material you may find on the Internet) as your own, nor should you share your own work with<br>others. It is fine, however, to discuss general concepts with your classmates as long as these discussions<br>do not lead to the actual exchange of code fragments or written solutions.<br>You hav e several sources for help. Your first recourse should always be to post your question on the ICON<br>discussion board. This is the fastest place to go for clarifications or disambiguation, or for help with<br>Python in general (remember, don’t post your solution or any part of your solution). Second, if you must<br>share a portion of your code, you can always attend a TA help session (see the announcement on ICON<br>entitled General TA Office Hours start Thursday, September 1 for times and locations). You may also<br>attend my office hours Tuesdays from 1:30 to 3:30 in my office (14 MLH). Finally, you may email your<br>code with a specific question to me or to your TA, but please be sure that you include CS1210 on the<br>subject line (also, this is the slowest way of getting help, due to the volume of mail we are likely to<br>receive).<br>What to Hand In<br>As before, for credit, you must make sure your function definitions exactly match the ‘‘signatures’’ giv en<br>in this problem specification. Your files should be uploaded to the HW5 dropbox folder in ICON by the<br>specified time and date: late assignments will not be accepted.<br>You should start building your solution file according to the template at the end of this assignment (the<br>template file, hw5.py, can be downloaded from ICON), substituting your own name for mine, obviously.<br>obviously. Note that the template file is incomplete and will not load in its present state.<br>3 Revised October 24, 2016<br>Make sure that you follow the instructions given for each function exactly, as the autograder expects these<br>functions to follow the naming convention shown. Also note the use of the comment character, #, at the<br>beginning of each line that is not intended to be interpreted by Python. You should use comments liberally<br>to explain what you are doing to the human reader.<br>4 Revised October 24, 2016<br><br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>中级难度<br><br>主要实现了细胞生成游戏。<br>需要实现游戏的逻辑代码，以及界面仿真代码。<br><br>首先：<br>完成代码的逻辑编写。比如活细胞和无细胞在不同的邻居个数的情况下，<br>下一代会是活细胞或者无细胞的判断。<br><br>其次需要实现接口函数，来显示不同的使用策略。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>The Game of Life is a well-known mathematical game that gives rise to amazingly<br>complex behavior, although it can be specified by a few simple rules. (It is not actually a<br>game in the traditional sense, with players competing for a win.) Here are the rules. The<br>game is played on a rectangular grid. Each square on the grid can be either empty<br>(represented by a 0 in our version) or occupied by a “living” cell (represented by a 1). At<br>the beginning, you can specify empty and occupied cells in some way; then the game<br>runs automatically. In each generation, the next generation is computed. A new cell is<br>born on an empty square if it is surrounded by exactly three occupied neighbor cells. A<br>cell dies of overcrowding if it is surrounded by four or more living neighbors, and it dies<br>of loneliness if it is surrounded by zero or one living neighbor. A neighbor is an occupant<br>of an adjacent square to the left, right, top, or bottom or in a diagonal direction. Figure 16<br>shows a cell and its neighbor cells.<br>Many configurations show interesting behavior when subjected to these rules. Figure 17<br>shows a glider, observed over five generations. Note how it moves. After four<br>generations, it is transformed into the identical shape, but located one square to the right<br>and below.<br>One of the more amazing configurations is the glider gun: a complex collection of cells<br>that, after 30 moves, turns back into itself and a glider (see the large figure at the end).<br>Over the next two weeks, you will use Python to program the game to eliminate the<br>drudgery of computing successive generations by hand. Your homework assignment will<br>come in two parts, also known as Programming Assignment 6 and Programming<br>Assignment 7. The Wikipedia page on The Game of Life has a lot of useful information,<br>as well as some real-time examples of program behavior. You should take a look at it.<br>Implementing this game requires a plan for what to do about the cells at the edges of the<br>grid, since those cells don’t have a full complement of eight neighbors. The Wikipedia<br>entry does bring up this issue, and options range from simple to complex. For our<br>purposes, it is sufficient to assume that every square outside of the grid is empty (i.e., 0)<br>and will remain empty for the duration of the game.<br>(Much of the description above, and all the figures below, is borrowed from a textbook<br>by Cay Horstmann.)<br>Programming Assignment 6 - Game of Life, Part 1<br>Your solution is to be written using Python 3. Make sure you provide comments<br>including the file name, your name, and the date at the top of the file you submit.<br>Also make sure to include appropriate docstrings for all functions.<br>The names of your functions must exactly match the names given in this assignment.<br>The order of the parameters in your parameter list must exactly match the order<br>given in this assignment.<br>For any given problem below, you may want to write additional functions other<br>than those specified for your solution. That’s fine with us.<br>The  core  problem  to  be  solved  in  the  implementation  of  the  Game  of  Life  is  how  to<br>generate  the  next  grid  from  the  current  grid.   Your  task  is  to  write  a  function  called<br>nextGen  which  expects  only  one  argument.   That  argument  is  a  two-­‐dimensional<br>table  (i.e.,  a  list  of  lists)  with  m  rows  and  n  columns,  representing  the  current  grid.<br>The  elements  of  the  table  are  either  0  (empty  square)  or  1  (occupied  square).   You<br>may  assume  that  all  rows  have  the  same  number  of  elements.<br>Given  the  current  grid,  nextGen  computes  and  returns  (but  does  not  print)  a  new<br>next  grid  (without  altering  the  current  grid)  by  applying  the  simple  rules  provided<br>above.   For  example,  given  this  initial  grid:<br>glider = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,1,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,1,0,0,0],<br>[0,1,1,1,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]<br>your function should work like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = nextGen(glider)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; y = nextGen(x)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; y<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; z = nextGen(y)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; z<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; q = nextGen(z)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; q<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>If we formatted those results nicely, we’d see a sequence like this:<br>## generation 1<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 2<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 3<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 4<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>These grids correspond to the generations in Figure 17. Note that the grid passed to your<br>function must remain unaltered:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; glider<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>Where to do the assignment<br>You can do this assignment on your own computer, or in the labs. In either case, use the<br>IDLE development environment – that’s what we’ll use when we grade your program.<br>Put all the functions you created in a file called “prog67.py”. Save that file until you’ve<br>completed Programming Assignment 7.<br>Submitting the Assignment<br>Do not turn in this assignment by itself. Submit it with the work you do for Programming<br>Assignment 7.<br>Saving your work<br>If you are working in the lab, you will need to copy your program to your own flash-drive<br>or save the program to your workspace on SmartSite. To save it on flash-drive, plug the<br>flash-drive into the computer (your TAs or the staff in the labs can help you figure out<br>how), open the flash-drive, and copy your work to it by moving the folder with your files<br>from the Desktop onto the flash-drive. To copy the file to your SmartSite workspace, go<br>to Workspace, select Resources, and then use the Add button next to “My Workspace”.<br>Your TAs can help you with this if you run into trouble.<br><br><br></font>

The structure of the tests<br>isn’t really as important as the testing plan, but we get to test both.<br>What to Test<br>We wanted to come up with a function for you to test that had a bit of everything: loops, selection, lists,<br>strings, dictionaries, objects, etc. But we had a bit of a conundrum. We wanted something complicated<br>enough to be interesting, but knew you were busy with your assignment, and didn’t want everyone to have<br>to spend lots of time writing a new function in order to test it.<br>That’s when it hit us. You’re already writing a function that you’ll probably want to test anyway…<br>cartesian product! It’s got everything we need, you already have to write it, and now it can help you test<br>your own code for A2. (A pretty smart move if I do say so myself).<br>How to Start<br>Before you start writing any code, you should think about coverage testing, and how we came up with a<br>test plan in lecture. Figure out all of the parameters, and the important ranges they fall into. Then write one<br>test for each possible combination of ranges. The goal here is to find one example test case for all possible<br>regions of your testing space.<br>Most of your actual tests will probably involve code that looks like this (now do you see why we made you<br>write set dict and get dict?<br>d1 = {…}<br>d2 = {…}<br>t1 = Table()<br>t2 = Table()<br>t1.set_dict(d1)<br>t2.set_dict(d2)<br>result_table = squeal.cartesian_product(t1, t2)<br>result_dict = result_table.get_dict()<br>expected_dict = {…}<br>self.assertEqual(result_dict, expected_dict)<br>What to Do<br>In a file called ex10.py, you should write a UnitTest to thoroughly test cartesian product. Your tests will<br>actually be run on a version of the code that I have written. Therefore, you will be doing black box testing<br>(you don’t know if I implemented the cartesian product or the Table class in the same way you will… in<br>fact, you can bet that I probably won’t). My cartesian product function will be in a file called squeal.py,<br>and my Table class will be in a file called database.py. Both will be placed into the same directory as your<br>UnitTest. We’ve provided you with some starter code, just to make sure you can access everything correctly.<br>What to Submit<br>Submit your ex10.py file to MarkUs as usual. Your UnitTest methods do not need any DocStrings, and<br>unless you’re doing something particularly unusual, you probably don’t need any internal comments either.<br>However, your method names and error messages should be descriptive enough to properly explain what<br>each test case does and why it’s useful. Remember that writing frivolous test cases is no better than missing<br>useful ones.<br>1<br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>低级难度<br><br>主要实现了利用三种方式来生成密码。<br>方法一： 随机法，前三位从A-Z生成，后三位从0-9生成。<br>方法二：右旋法，即参照ACSII码表来生成，比如A转换成D.<br>方法三：藏尾法，即输入一句话，从句子中的每一个单词的最后一位组成密码。<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br><br>Write a Python program that generates passwords in three different ways.<br>a)Generate a random 6 character password. The first 3 characters must be capital letters (A – Z) and the second 3 characters must be numeric characters (0 – 9).<br><br>b)Enter a secret word and then specify an amount of ‘right shift’ of the characters to encrypt your word. This simple method to encrypt data is attributed to Julius Caesar, the Roman Emperor. (If you are interested, you may like to read the following… <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank" rel="external">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher</a>). This method takes each character in a message and replaces it with one which is a certain distance (offset) along the alphabet from it (moving right). For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . . . . . A B C D E F G H I J K L M . . . +3 A B C D E F G H I J . . . If the offset is 3 then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F etc. In this case the word DIG encrypts to GLJ. In order to decrypt the word/string, simply offset by the same amount moving in the opposite direction (i.e. moving left). Instead of restricting the cipher to the alphabetic characters only, we will use all of the printable ASCII characters. That is, all the characters from ASCII 32 (Space) to ASCII 126 (~).<br><br> You will need to use the following two functions - ord(c) Given c, a string of length one ord(c), returns an integer representing the value of the string. For example: ord(‘a’) returns the integer 97. chr(i) Returns a string of one character whose ASCII code is the integer i. For example: chr(97) returns the string ‘a’.<br>c)Enter a secret sentence and create a password by taking the last letter of each word.<br><br>Write a menu driven program called yourId_encryptor.py that will allow the user to enter commands and process these commands until the quit command is entered.<br><br><br><br></font>

Update 12/2: clarified Grade <strong>init</strong> and<br>Student <strong>str</strong> requirements. Update 11/30: clarified specifications of <strong>init</strong> and <strong>str</strong> and added a<br>note about the sample test file).<br>Assignment Overview<br>This assignment focuses on the implementation of two Python classes to store grades of students in a<br>class.<br>It is worth 55 points (5.5% of course grade) and must be completed no later than 11:59 PM on Tuesday,<br>December 6.<br>Assignment Specifications<br>You will develop “Student” and “Grade” classes and implement all the methods described in the<br>following section.<br>You will demonstrate that your implementation of the classes are correct by developing a program<br>which serves as a test bed for that class.<br>You will develop an application program which uses those classes to read “students.txt” and “grades.txt”<br>files and store their data in instances of Student and Grade classes.<br>Assignment Deliverables<br>The deliverables for this assignment are the following files:<br>classes.py  – the source code for your Student and Grade classes<br>proj11-test.py – the source code for your test program<br>proj11-app.py – the source code for your application program<br>Be sure to use the specified file names and submit them for grading via the handin system before the<br>project deadline.<br>Specifications for Class Grade<br>1. The constructor (method <strong>init</strong>) will accept 3 values as parameters, name of the<br>assignment (string), grade and assignment weight (floats). All three parameters must have<br>default values—you choose appropriate ones. Also, the attributes cannot be private because you<br>need to access them in the Student class. That is, do not use double underscores in your names,<br>i.e. do not use an attribute name such as self.<strong>name.<br>2. The string method (</strong>str<strong>) and representation method (</strong>repr<strong>) should return a string<br>that includes the name, grade and weight of the Grade object in one line.<br>Specifications for Class Student<br>1. The constructor (method </strong>init<strong>) will accept 4 values as parameters, student id (int), first<br>name (string), last name (string), and a list of all the grade objects for that student. All three<br>parameters must have default values—you choose appropriate ones, but the appropriate default<br>value for a list parameter is None, not an empty list ([]).<br>2. add_grade method should take a Grade object as a parameter and append it to a list of grades<br>for that student.<br>3. calculate_grade should multiply all the grade points of the student by their weight and<br>return the final course grade. (Each Grade object in the list has a value and weight that should be<br>multiplied together. The sum of all the calculations results the final weighted grade of the student<br>in the course)<br>4. The string method (</strong>str<strong>) and representation method (</strong>repr<strong>) should return a string<br>that has the student’s name (with last name first with a comma between the last name and first<br>name) includes all the grades of the student. This method must call the </strong>str<strong> method of the<br>Grade objects. Note that implicitly calling the </strong>str<strong> method is fine such as str() or<br>format(), but do not access the individual attributes such as grade.name.<br>5. </strong>gt<strong>, </strong>lt<strong> and </strong>eq<strong> methods should compare the final grades of two students<br>together.<br>Note that you can use calculate_grade method to calculate the final grade of two students.<br>Never use “==” to check for equality of two float numbers (because floats are approximations<br>of real numbers). Instead, find the absolute value of the difference of two numbers; if the<br>difference is less than epsilon (a very small number such as 10**-6), the floats are equal to<br>each other (that is they are close enough to consider them to be equal). Python has an absolute<br>value function: abs()<br>Please note that you may wish to use function “print” to display various items as you are developing<br>your implementation of the class. However, all invocations of function “print” must be removed from<br>the final version of your classes (or at least turned into comments).<br>Hint: check the “Student” class in page 546 of the book for reference.<br>Specifications for the Test Program<br>1. You will develop a program to serve as a test bed for classes. That is, the only purpose of the<br>program is to demonstrate that each method of your “Student” and “Grade” classes is implemented<br>correctly. The source code for your test bed will be contained in the file named “proj11-test.py”. That<br>file will import “classes.py”. A file named “proj11-test.py” is provided as a starting template.<br>2. Your test bed will not perform any input operations. Instead, all test cases will be embedded in the<br>program itself.<br>3. The output produced by your test bed must be appropriately labeled so that the reader can understand<br>the purpose and result of each test case without examining the source code. For example, when<br>demonstrating </strong>lt<strong> you might print “Demonstrating Fred &lt; Mary” followed by<br>print(Fred&lt;Mary)<br>Specifications for the Application Program<br>1. You will develop an application program which uses both classes to solve the problem described<br>below.<br>The source code for your application program will be contained in the file named “proj11-app.py”. That<br>file will import “classes.py”.<br>2. The program will attempt to access the files named “students.txt” and “grades.txt”. If any of the<br>input files cannot be opened, the program will display an appropriate message and halt. (Since the first<br>posted version of this document didn’t specify that the program must prompt for these two file names,<br>you have the option of prompting for them or not. However, if you prompt for them, our test program<br>will provide the name grades.txt to the first prompt and students.txt to the second prompt.)<br>3. The grades.txt file will contain three or more lines. The first line contains the weight of each<br>assignment, the second line contains the labels and the name of the assignments. Line 3 and subsequent<br>lines contain grade information for a student. Each line has a student id and all the grades of a student.<br>The information of each assignment should be stored in an instance of “Grade” class. A list of Grade<br>objects should be passed to the constructor of “Student” class.<br>4. The students.txt file will contain one or more lines, where each line contains the information of a<br>student. Each line has an id, first name and last name. That information should be stored in an instance<br>of “Student” class along with the list of “Grade” objects explained above.<br>5. The application should store all “Student” objects in a list and should print them ( print(student) ) like<br>the sample output provided below.<br>6. The application should print the class average at the end.<br>Assignment Notes<br>1. You would be wise to develop your implementation of “Student” and “Grade” classes and your test<br>program incrementally and in parallel. That is, implement one class method at a time and then test that<br>method by adding statements to your test program.<br>Clearly, the first class method which must be implemented and tested is the constructor (</strong>init<strong>).<br>Perhaps the second class method to implement and test is </strong>str__ so that you have a way to display<br>the value of an object of type “Student” and “Grade” using function “print”.<br>After implementing and testing those methods, you would continue to implement and test one method at<br>a time until you have completed the class.<br>Be sure to insert and test any necessary error handling at the appropriate time.<br>2. Approximately 60% of the 55 points available for the project will be allocated to the implementation<br>of “Student” and “Grade” classes, approximately 15% will be allocated to the test program, and<br>approximately 25% will be allocated to the application program.<br>Sample Output (Application file)<br>Hopper, Grace<br>proj01 : 75% 0.07<br>proj02 : 81% 0.08<br>proj03 : 91% 0.10<br>proj04 : 87% 0.10<br>proj05 : 73% 0.15<br>exam01 : 90% 0.20<br>exam02 : 86% 0.30<br>Final grade: 84%<br>Knuth, Donald<br>proj01 : 79% 0.07<br>proj02 : 73% 0.08<br>proj03 : 83% 0.10<br>proj04 : 87% 0.10<br>proj05 : 82% 0.15<br>exam01 : 97% 0.20<br>exam02 : 99% 0.30<br>Final grade: 89%<br>Goldberg, Adele<br>proj01 : 92% 0.07<br>proj02 : 82% 0.08<br>proj03 : 92% 0.10<br>proj04 : 83% 0.10<br>proj05 : 96% 0.15<br>exam01 : 92% 0.20<br>exam02 : 93% 0.30<br>Final grade: 91%<br>Kernighan, Brian<br>proj01 : 77% 0.07<br>proj02 : 95% 0.08<br>proj03 : 98% 0.10<br>proj04 : 87% 0.10<br>proj05 : 87% 0.15<br>exam01 : 85% 0.20<br>exam02 : 82% 0.30<br>Final grade: 86%<br>Liskov, Barbara<br>proj01 : 72% 0.07<br>proj02 : 82% 0.08<br>proj03 : 98% 0.10<br>proj04 : 90% 0.10<br>proj05 : 75% 0.15<br>exam01 : 98% 0.20<br>exam02 : 94% 0.30<br>Final grade: 89%<br>The class average is 88.17%<br>========================================<br>Educational Research<br>When you have completed the project insert the 5-line comment specified below.<br>For each of the following statements, please respond with how much they apply to your experience<br>completing the programming project, on the following scale:<br>1 = Strongly disagree / Not true of me at all<br>2<br>3<br>4 = Neither agree nor disagree / Somewhat true of me<br>5<br>6<br>7 = Strongly agree / Extremely true of me<br><strong><em>Please note that your responses to these questions will not affect your project grade, so please<br>answer as honestly as possible.</em></strong><br>Q1: Upon completing the project, I felt proud/accomplished<br>Q2: While working on the project, I often felt frustrated/annoyed<br>Q3: While working on the project, I felt inadequate/stupid<br>Q4: Considering the difficulty of this course, the teacher, and my skills, I think I will do well in<br>this course.<br>Please insert your answers into the bottom of your project program as a comment, formatted exactly as<br>follows (so we can write a program to extract them).<br># Questions<br># Q1: 5<br># Q2: 3<br># Q3: 4<br># Q4: 6<br><br><br><br><br></font>

Learning Goals<br>Learn how to<br>1. use associative containers like ​std::unordered_set​ and ​std::unordered_map<br>2. use iterators to iterate through associative containers<br>3. use ​algorithms​ that are available in the C++ Standard Library<br>4. pass command line arguments to a C++ program<br>5. partition a C++ program in header files (.hpp) and source files (.cpp)<br>6. read, understand, and use code written by other people<br>2. Description<br>In this assignment you’ll be doing the following:<br>1. Read a raw text file containing movie reviews and ratings.<br>2. Remove the punctuations and stopwords (e.g. is, and, the, etc.) from the reviews and<br>write the contents to a clean review file.<br>3. Associate a value for all words found in the clean reviews based on the average rating of<br>the word.<br>4. Using the map between the words and their associated values, rate reviews from<br>another file that doesn’t have any rating already.<br>5. Write the ratings of the reviews to an output file.<br>2.1. Clean the data<br>The raw data with the reviews and the rating will be present in a file named<br>rawReviewRatings.txt​. Every review is given a rating between 0 - 4 (both inclusive). The<br>following are interpretation of the rating values:<br>● 0 = Negative<br>● 1 = Somewhat Negative<br>● 2 = Neutral<br>● 3 = Somewhat Positive<br>● 4 = Positive<br>Each line of review follows the following format:<br><rating> <review><br>Example:<br>4 The Jungle Book is awesome!<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>where 4 is the rating and the text “The Jungle Book is awesome!” is the review.<br>Now, your first task is to read the contents of this file and ​clean the data!<br>The following steps needs to be performed in the same order for cleaning the data:<br>1. Read the raw reviews from an input file. e.g. ​rawReviewRatings.txt<br>2. Replace the hyphens in every line of text with spaces.<br>e.g. If the review contains the word “awe-inspiring”, then it should be split into 2 words<br>namely “awe” and “inspiring”<br>3. Split each line of text into multiple words using the space character as the delimiter.<br>e.g. “The Jungle Book is awesome!” becomes | “The” | “Jungle” | “Book” | “is” |<br>“awesome!” |<br>4. Remove the punctuation marks from the words.<br>e.g. “awesome!” becomes “awesome” and “!” becomes “”<br>5. If there are any trailing/leading whitespaces, then remove them. Remember that the<br>space character (‘ ’), tab (‘\t’), newline (‘\n’), etc. are considered as whitespaces. For a<br>complete list of whitespace characters ​this​.<br>e.g. “zootopia ” becomes “zootopia”, “hello\t” becomes “hello”, and “world\n” becomes<br>“world”<br>6. Remove the empty words. i.e. words with length == 0.<br>7. Remove single lettered words. i.e. words with length == 1.<br>8. Remove stopwords. e.g. is, and, the, etc. The list of stopwords can be found in the file<br>stopwords.txt<br>9. Write the contents of the clean data to a file named ​cleanReviewRatings.txt​.<br>2.2.

Rate new reviews<br>Using the map/dictionary that we created in the previous step, we are going to read new unrated<br>reviews from a file (e.g. ​rawReviews.txt​) and predict a rating for each review in this file. The<br>predicted rating for each review is written to an output file named ​ratings.txt​.<br>How do we predict the ratings for the unrated reviews?<br>1. Read the input file with the unrated raw reviews (e.g. ​rawReviews.txt​).<br>2. Clean the data and produce an output file named ​cleanReviews.txt​. The process for<br>cleaning the data is exactly the same as we did in step 2.1.<br>3. Rate each review by finding the rating for each word from the map/dictionary that we<br>created in step 2.2. The rating for a line of review is the average value of the rating of all<br>the words in the review. If some word in this unrated review is not found in the<br>map/dictionary, then that word is given a neutral rating of 2. If a review is empty (i.e. the<br>review contains no words in it), then such a review is also given a neutral rating of 2.<br>e.g. Let see how we computed the rating for the 2nd review in ​cleanReviews.txt (i.e.<br>“The Lion King fantastic”). We lookup the map/dictionary that we created before and get<br>the average rating for each word in this review. The average ratings of each word in this<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>review is shown below:<br>The: 6/2 = 3<br>Lion: 5/2 = 2.5<br>King: 5/2 = 2.5<br>fantastic: 10/3 = 3.33<br>Based on these individual values, this line gets and average review of 2.83 as shown in<br>the file ​ratings.txt​.<br>Rating for this line = (3 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 3.33) / 4 = 2.83<br>We are dividing by 4 since this review contains 4 words in total.<br>Another example: “Finding Nemo great”<br>Finding: 1<br>Nemo: 2 (because it is NOT found in the map)<br>great: 2 (because it is also NOT found in the map)<br>Rating for this line = (1 + 2 + 2) / 3 = 1.67<br>4. Write the ratings for all the reviews to an output file named ​ratings.txt​.<br>A high-level process diagram of the steps explained in 2.1 - 2.3 is shown.

Learning Goals<br>Learn how to<br>1. use associative containers like ​std::unordered_set​ and ​std::unordered_map<br>2. use iterators to iterate through associative containers<br>3. use ​algorithms​ that are available in the C++ Standard Library<br>4. pass command line arguments to a C++ program<br>5. partition a C++ program in header files (.hpp) and source files (.cpp)<br>6. read, understand, and use code written by other people<br>2. Description<br>In this assignment you’ll be doing the following:<br>1. Read a raw text file containing movie reviews and ratings.<br>2. Remove the punctuations and stopwords (e.g. is, and, the, etc.) from the reviews and<br>write the contents to a clean review file.<br>3. Associate a value for all words found in the clean reviews based on the average rating of<br>the word.<br>4. Using the map between the words and their associated values, rate reviews from<br>another file that doesn’t have any rating already.<br>5. Write the ratings of the reviews to an output file.<br>2.1. Clean the data<br>The raw data with the reviews and the rating will be present in a file named<br>rawReviewRatings.txt​. Every review is given a rating between 0 - 4 (both inclusive). The<br>following are interpretation of the rating values:<br>● 0 = Negative<br>● 1 = Somewhat Negative<br>● 2 = Neutral<br>● 3 = Somewhat Positive<br>● 4 = Positive<br>Each line of review follows the following format:<br><rating> <review><br>Example:<br>4 The Jungle Book is awesome!<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>where 4 is the rating and the text “The Jungle Book is awesome!” is the review.<br>Now, your first task is to read the contents of this file and ​clean the data!<br>The following steps needs to be performed in the same order for cleaning the data:<br>1. Read the raw reviews from an input file. e.g. ​rawReviewRatings.txt<br>2. Replace the hyphens in every line of text with spaces.<br>e.g. If the review contains the word “awe-inspiring”, then it should be split into 2 words<br>namely “awe” and “inspiring”<br>3. Split each line of text into multiple words using the space character as the delimiter.<br>e.g. “The Jungle Book is awesome!” becomes | “The” | “Jungle” | “Book” | “is” |<br>“awesome!” |<br>4. Remove the punctuation marks from the words.<br>e.g. “awesome!” becomes “awesome” and “!” becomes “”<br>5. If there are any trailing/leading whitespaces, then remove them. Remember that the<br>space character (‘ ’), tab (‘\t’), newline (‘\n’), etc. are considered as whitespaces. For a<br>complete list of whitespace characters ​this​.<br>e.g. “zootopia ” becomes “zootopia”, “hello\t” becomes “hello”, and “world\n” becomes<br>“world”<br>6. Remove the empty words. i.e. words with length == 0.<br>7. Remove single lettered words. i.e. words with length == 1.<br>8. Remove stopwords. e.g. is, and, the, etc. The list of stopwords can be found in the file<br>stopwords.txt<br>9. Write the contents of the clean data to a file named ​cleanReviewRatings.txt​.<br>2.2. Fill the dictionary<br>Using the ​cleanReviewRatings.txt file, create a map/dictionary for every word that is found in<br>this file.

Heavy penalties will<br>apply for late submission. This is an individual assignment and must be entirely your own work. You must<br>attribute the source of any part of your code which you have not written yourself. Please note the section on<br>plagiarism in this document.<br>The assignment must be done using the BlueJ environment. All user input to the system, and system<br>output to the user, must be done at the BlueJ terminal window. No other graphical interfaces are to be<br>used (nor assessed) in your program.<br>The Java source code for this assignment must be implemented according to the FIT9131 Java Coding<br>Standards.<br>Any points needing clarification should be discussed with your tutor in the tutorial class. You should not<br>make any assumptions about the program without consulting with your tutor.<br>Specification<br>For this assignment you are required to write a program that implements a simple Student Management<br>System for a very small, fictional, school. This section specifies the required functionality of the program.<br>The aim of the Student Management System is for a user (the school’s enrolment staff) to keep a database of<br>the students enrolled in various subjects in this fictional school. This school only offers three (3) subjects :<br>Computing, Maths, and English. The system will allow the user to add/delete students, enrol them in<br>subjects, and perform simple reports.<br>Even though this program is functionally very different from the program you wrote in Assignment 1, you<br>should be able to re-use much of your previous code here - if you have designed the classes/logic in your<br>previous program properly. This is one of the major benefits of an object-oriented program - the ability to<br>re-use classes.<br>The Student Management System should provide the following features :<br> maintains a list (using a Java Collection class) of Student objects<br>o each Student object represents a person who is allowed to enrol in the fictional school<br> maintains a fixed list of exactly 3 Subject objects<br>o each Subject object represents a subject which is available in the fictional school<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 2<br> enrol each student in a subject, or subjects (HD level)<br> lists the details of an existing student<br> produces a report of students based on some criteria<br> loads a list of students (with their enrolled subjects) from a text file<br> saves the list of current students (with their enrolled subjects) to a text file<br>You are to demonstrate the following programming techniques in your program :<br> reading/writing data from/to text files<br> using appropriate Java Collection class or classes to store data<br> using code to manipulate the data in the collection(s)<br> performing simple searches, filtered by some given criteria<br> using program constructs such as repetitions &amp; selections<br> using appropriate classes to represent objects in the program<br>There will be a description of the “HD level” features later in this document (in the Grades section).<br>You are also required to produce a partial Test Strategy for your program.<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 3<br>Program Logic<br>When the Student Management System starts, it should automatically load a text file called<br>“students.txt” which contains details of all students currently stored in the system. The actual format<br>of this text file is described later in this document. The data loaded should be stored in some appropriate data<br>structures. No other reading from or writing to file is required while the program is in operation, until the<br>user chooses to exit, at which point the program saves all the data in memory back to the same text file<br>(students.txt).<br>In other words, the file I/O operations are performed automatically by the program, and require no<br>interactions with the user.<br>When the program is running, it should repeatedly display a menu with these options :<br>(1) Add new student<br>(2) Delete a student<br>(3) Find Student By Name<br>(4) List Students By Subject<br>(5) List All Students<br>(6) Exit System<br>Option (1) allows the user to add a new student into the database. The user should be asked for the student’s<br>details, plus what subject to “enrol” him/her in.<br>Option (2) allows the user to remove an existing student from the database.<br>Option (3) allows the user to find an existing student in the database. The user should be asked to enter a<br>name to search for. If a matching student is found, his/her details will be displayed.<br>Option (4) allows the user to display a list of students enrolled in a subject. The user should be asked for a<br>subject name; a list of all students (if any) enrolled in that subject should then be displayed.<br>Option (5) allows the user to display a list of all students enrolled in the school.<br>Option (6) exits the program. All the students currently in memory are automatically saved to<br>“students.txt”.<br>Inputs other than 1-6 should be rejected, and an error message printed. The menu should be displayed<br>repeatedly, until the user chooses Option (6).<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 4<br>Important Assumptions<br>You should observe the following assumptions when implementing your program :<br> all student names are unique - if a student is already in the database, trying to add the same name<br>again should generate an error<br> there is no limit to how many students can be enrolled<br> exactly 3 subjects are offered : Computing, Maths and English<br> each student can only enrol in exactly one subject<br> all searches use exact matches (eg. “andy” will not match “andy cheng”); however, the search<br>strings are not case-sensitive (eg. “Sue Smith” is considered to be the same as “SUE smith”)<br> the data file is always in the correct format - ie. no need to validate the data when reading it in<br>Student Record Format<br>Each student in the database contains the following information :<br> Name (non-blank String, may contain multiple words)<br> Telephone (non-blank String, exactly 9 digits, 1st digit must be a ‘9’)<br> Subject (a String, representing one of the 3 subjects offered)<br>Input File Format<br>The input data file (students.txt) has the following format for each line :<br>Name,Telephone,Subject  (the fields are separated by commas)<br>Eg.<br>David Smith,912345678,Maths<br>Andy Cheng,987654321,Computing<br>Susan Dally,911221122,English<br>Zak Whatever,999999999,Maths<br>Russell Crowe,980808080,Computing<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 5<br>Program Design<br>Your program must demonstrate your understanding of the object-oriented concepts and general<br>programming constructs presented in FIT9131. You must use appropriate data structures to store the various<br>objects (list of students, list of subjects, etc) in the program.<br>You must be able to justify the choice of the data structures during your interview. You must document any<br>additional assumptions you made.<br>Validation of values for fields and local variables should also be implemented. You should not allow an<br>object of a class to be set to an invalid state.<br>Discuss with your tutor regarding what classes are appropriate, and how they interact with each other.<br>The main requirements are : (1) the Students and Subjects must be implemented as objects, and they must<br>be stored in some appropriate Java collections, and (2) for the HD level , the list of Subjects within each<br>Student object must also be stored in some appropriate Java collections.<br>Your program must deal with invalid values entered by the user in a sensible manner. For instance, if a user<br>enters “abc” instead of a number for the menu options, your program should not crash.<br>All on-screen input/output should be formatted in a user-friendly manner. Sensible error messages should be<br>displayed whenever appropriate (eg. when searching for a student who is not in the database, trying to enrol<br>student in a subject which does not exist, etc).<br>Grades<br>There are 2 possible Grade Categories for this assignment, as described below :<br>1) A maximum grade of up to a D (Distinction) can be achieved by correctly implementing all the<br>features as described in the “Program Logic” section above.<br>2) To achieve up to a maximum of a HD (High Distinction), you need to implement the following<br>additional features :<br> for Option (1), a student can be enrolled in up to a maximum of 3 unique subjects<br> for Option (4), the user can specify more than 1 subject, and the program will display all<br>students listed in those subjects (eg. all students enrolled in both “Computing” AND “English”,<br>all students enrolled in “Computing” AND “Maths” AND “English”, etc)<br>Note : The description of the program’s logic/design is intentionally left vague, to give you some room<br>to exercise your own design and creativity. Discuss with your tutor about what/how to implement.<br>Important : You must not attempt the HD Category until you have fully implemented the D<br>Category. If you submit a program which partially implements both, you will only be awarded up<br>to a maximum of D.<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 6<br>Test Strategy<br>For this assignment, you are required to produce a partial Test Strategy for the program.<br>There is no need to produce Test Strategy for any other classes you have used in your program.<br>You must provide a Test Plan, plus detailed sets of Test Data, Expected Results and Actual Results for the<br>Student class.<br>Assessment<br>Assessment for this assignment will be done via an interview with your tutor. The marks will be allocated as<br>follows:<br> Test Strategy : 10%<br> Java Code &amp; Object-Oriented Design : 35%<br> Program Functionality in accordance with the requirements : 55%<br>You must submit your work by the submission deadline on the due date (a late penalty of 20% per day of<br>the possible marks will apply).<br>Marks will be deducted for untidy submissions and non-conformances to the FIT9131 Java Coding<br>Standards.<br>Interview<br>You will be asked to demonstrate your program at an interview following the submission date. At the<br>interview you can also expect to be asked to explain your code, your design, discuss design decisions and<br>alternatives and modify your code as required. Marks will not be awarded for any section of code or<br>functionality that a student cannot explain satisfactorily. (The marker may delete excessive comments in<br>code before a student is asked to explain that code).<br>In other words, you will be assessed on your understanding of the code, and not on the actual code itself.<br>Interview times will be arranged in the tutorial labs in Week 12. It is your responsibility to attend the lab and<br>arrange an interview time with your tutor. Any student who does not attend an interview will receive a mark<br>of 0 for the assignment.<br>The actual interviews will take place in Week 13.<br>Your Test Strategy will be only for one class - the Student class.<br>FIT9131 Semester 2 2016 Assignment 2<br>14 September 2016 7<br>Submission Requirements<br>The assignment must be uploaded to Moodle on or before the due date. The link to upload the assignment<br>will be made available in the Assignments section of the unit’s Moodle site before the submission deadline.<br>The submission requirements are as follows:<br>A .zip file uploaded to Moodle containing the following components:<br> the BlueJ project you created to implement your assignment. The .zip should be named with your<br>Student ID Number. For example, if your id is 12345678, then the file should be named<br>12345678_A2.zip. Do not name your file any other way.<br> it is your responsibility to check that your ZIP file contains all the correct files, and is not corrupted,<br>before you submit it. If you tutor cannot open your zip file, or if it does not contain the correct files,<br>you will not be assessed.<br> an MS Word document containing your Test Strategy for the Student class.  (Note: The JUnit facility in<br>BlueJ is NOT to be used for this assignment)<br> a completed Assignment Cover Sheet. This will be available for download from the unit’s Moodle site<br>before the submission deadline. You simply complete the editable sections of the document, save it, and<br>include it in your .zip file for submission.<br>Marks will be deducted for failure to comply with any of these requirements.<br>Warning : there will be no extensions to the due date. Any late submission will incur the 20% per day<br>penalty. It is strongly suggested that you submit the assignment well before the deadline, in case there are<br>some unexpected complications on the day (eg. interruptions to your home internet connection).<br>Plagiarism<br>Cheating and plagiarism are viewed as serious offences. In cases where cheating has been confirmed,<br>students have been severely penalised, from losing all marks for an assignment, to facing disciplinary action<br>at the Faculty level. Monash has several policies in relation to these offences and it is your responsibility to<br>acquaint yourself with these.<br>Plagiarism (<a href="http://www.policy.monash.edu/policybank/academic/education/conduct/plagiarism-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.policy.monash.edu/policybank/academic/education/conduct/plagiarism-policy.html</a>)<br>Discipline: Student Policy (<a href="http://www.policy.monash.edu/policy-" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.policy.monash.edu/policy-</a><br>bank/academic/education/conduct/student-discipline-policy.html<br><br><br></font>
