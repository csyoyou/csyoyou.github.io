        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>中级难度<br><br>主要实现了细胞生成游戏。<br>需要实现游戏的逻辑代码，以及界面仿真代码。<br><br>首先：<br>完成代码的逻辑编写。比如活细胞和无细胞在不同的邻居个数的情况下，<br>下一代会是活细胞或者无细胞的判断。<br><br>其次需要实现接口函数，来显示不同的使用策略。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>The Game of Life is a well-known mathematical game that gives rise to amazingly<br>complex behavior, although it can be specified by a few simple rules. (It is not actually a<br>game in the traditional sense, with players competing for a win.) Here are the rules. The<br>game is played on a rectangular grid. Each square on the grid can be either empty<br>(represented by a 0 in our version) or occupied by a “living” cell (represented by a 1). At<br>the beginning, you can specify empty and occupied cells in some way; then the game<br>runs automatically. In each generation, the next generation is computed. A new cell is<br>born on an empty square if it is surrounded by exactly three occupied neighbor cells. A<br>cell dies of overcrowding if it is surrounded by four or more living neighbors, and it dies<br>of loneliness if it is surrounded by zero or one living neighbor. A neighbor is an occupant<br>of an adjacent square to the left, right, top, or bottom or in a diagonal direction. Figure 16<br>shows a cell and its neighbor cells.<br>Many configurations show interesting behavior when subjected to these rules. Figure 17<br>shows a glider, observed over five generations. Note how it moves. After four<br>generations, it is transformed into the identical shape, but located one square to the right<br>and below.<br>One of the more amazing configurations is the glider gun: a complex collection of cells<br>that, after 30 moves, turns back into itself and a glider (see the large figure at the end).<br>Over the next two weeks, you will use Python to program the game to eliminate the<br>drudgery of computing successive generations by hand. Your homework assignment will<br>come in two parts, also known as Programming Assignment 6 and Programming<br>Assignment 7. The Wikipedia page on The Game of Life has a lot of useful information,<br>as well as some real-time examples of program behavior. You should take a look at it.<br>Implementing this game requires a plan for what to do about the cells at the edges of the<br>grid, since those cells don’t have a full complement of eight neighbors. The Wikipedia<br>entry does bring up this issue, and options range from simple to complex. For our<br>purposes, it is sufficient to assume that every square outside of the grid is empty (i.e., 0)<br>and will remain empty for the duration of the game.<br>(Much of the description above, and all the figures below, is borrowed from a textbook<br>by Cay Horstmann.)<br>Programming Assignment 6 - Game of Life, Part 1<br>Your solution is to be written using Python 3. Make sure you provide comments<br>including the file name, your name, and the date at the top of the file you submit.<br>Also make sure to include appropriate docstrings for all functions.<br>The names of your functions must exactly match the names given in this assignment.<br>The order of the parameters in your parameter list must exactly match the order<br>given in this assignment.<br>For any given problem below, you may want to write additional functions other<br>than those specified for your solution. That’s fine with us.<br>The  core  problem  to  be  solved  in  the  implementation  of  the  Game  of  Life  is  how  to<br>generate  the  next  grid  from  the  current  grid.   Your  task  is  to  write  a  function  called<br>nextGen  which  expects  only  one  argument.   That  argument  is  a  two-­‐dimensional<br>table  (i.e.,  a  list  of  lists)  with  m  rows  and  n  columns,  representing  the  current  grid.<br>The  elements  of  the  table  are  either  0  (empty  square)  or  1  (occupied  square).   You<br>may  assume  that  all  rows  have  the  same  number  of  elements.<br>Given  the  current  grid,  nextGen  computes  and  returns  (but  does  not  print)  a  new<br>next  grid  (without  altering  the  current  grid)  by  applying  the  simple  rules  provided<br>above.   For  example,  given  this  initial  grid:<br>glider = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,1,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,1,0,0,0],<br>[0,1,1,1,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],<br>[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]<br>your function should work like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = nextGen(glider)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; y = nextGen(x)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; y<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; z = nextGen(y)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; z<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; q = nextGen(z)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; q<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>If we formatted those results nicely, we’d see a sequence like this:<br>## generation 1<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 2<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 3<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>## generation 4<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>These grids correspond to the generations in Figure 17. Note that the grid passed to your<br>function must remain unaltered:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; glider<br>[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],<br>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]<br>Where to do the assignment<br>You can do this assignment on your own computer, or in the labs. In either case, use the<br>IDLE development environment – that’s what we’ll use when we grade your program.<br>Put all the functions you created in a file called “prog67.py”. Save that file until you’ve<br>completed Programming Assignment 7.<br>Submitting the Assignment<br>Do not turn in this assignment by itself. Submit it with the work you do for Programming<br>Assignment 7.<br>Saving your work<br>If you are working in the lab, you will need to copy your program to your own flash-drive<br>or save the program to your workspace on SmartSite. To save it on flash-drive, plug the<br>flash-drive into the computer (your TAs or the staff in the labs can help you figure out<br>how), open the flash-drive, and copy your work to it by moving the folder with your files<br>from the Desktop onto the flash-drive. To copy the file to your SmartSite workspace, go<br>to Workspace, select Resources, and then use the Add button next to “My Workspace”.<br>Your TAs can help you with this if you run into trouble.<br><br><br></font>

The structure of the tests<br>isn’t really as important as the testing plan, but we get to test both.<br>What to Test<br>We wanted to come up with a function for you to test that had a bit of everything: loops, selection, lists,<br>strings, dictionaries, objects, etc. But we had a bit of a conundrum. We wanted something complicated<br>enough to be interesting, but knew you were busy with your assignment, and didn’t want everyone to have<br>to spend lots of time writing a new function in order to test it.<br>That’s when it hit us. You’re already writing a function that you’ll probably want to test anyway…<br>cartesian product! It’s got everything we need, you already have to write it, and now it can help you test<br>your own code for A2. (A pretty smart move if I do say so myself).<br>How to Start<br>Before you start writing any code, you should think about coverage testing, and how we came up with a<br>test plan in lecture. Figure out all of the parameters, and the important ranges they fall into. Then write one<br>test for each possible combination of ranges. The goal here is to find one example test case for all possible<br>regions of your testing space.<br>Most of your actual tests will probably involve code that looks like this (now do you see why we made you<br>write set dict and get dict?<br>d1 = {…}<br>d2 = {…}<br>t1 = Table()<br>t2 = Table()<br>t1.set_dict(d1)<br>t2.set_dict(d2)<br>result_table = squeal.cartesian_product(t1, t2)<br>result_dict = result_table.get_dict()<br>expected_dict = {…}<br>self.assertEqual(result_dict, expected_dict)<br>What to Do<br>In a file called ex10.py, you should write a UnitTest to thoroughly test cartesian product. Your tests will<br>actually be run on a version of the code that I have written. Therefore, you will be doing black box testing<br>(you don’t know if I implemented the cartesian product or the Table class in the same way you will… in<br>fact, you can bet that I probably won’t). My cartesian product function will be in a file called squeal.py,<br>and my Table class will be in a file called database.py. Both will be placed into the same directory as your<br>UnitTest. We’ve provided you with some starter code, just to make sure you can access everything correctly.<br>What to Submit<br>Submit your ex10.py file to MarkUs as usual. Your UnitTest methods do not need any DocStrings, and<br>unless you’re doing something particularly unusual, you probably don’t need any internal comments either.<br>However, your method names and error messages should be descriptive enough to properly explain what<br>each test case does and why it’s useful. Remember that writing frivolous test cases is no better than missing<br>useful ones.<br>1<br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>低级难度<br><br>主要实现了利用三种方式来生成密码。<br>方法一： 随机法，前三位从A-Z生成，后三位从0-9生成。<br>方法二：右旋法，即参照ACSII码表来生成，比如A转换成D.<br>方法三：藏尾法，即输入一句话，从句子中的每一个单词的最后一位组成密码。<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br><br>Write a Python program that generates passwords in three different ways.<br>a)Generate a random 6 character password. The first 3 characters must be capital letters (A – Z) and the second 3 characters must be numeric characters (0 – 9).<br><br>b)Enter a secret word and then specify an amount of ‘right shift’ of the characters to encrypt your word. This simple method to encrypt data is attributed to Julius Caesar, the Roman Emperor. (If you are interested, you may like to read the following… <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank" rel="external">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher</a>). This method takes each character in a message and replaces it with one which is a certain distance (offset) along the alphabet from it (moving right). For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . . . . . A B C D E F G H I J K L M . . . +3 A B C D E F G H I J . . . If the offset is 3 then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F etc. In this case the word DIG encrypts to GLJ. In order to decrypt the word/string, simply offset by the same amount moving in the opposite direction (i.e. moving left). Instead of restricting the cipher to the alphabetic characters only, we will use all of the printable ASCII characters. That is, all the characters from ASCII 32 (Space) to ASCII 126 (~).<br><br> You will need to use the following two functions - ord(c) Given c, a string of length one ord(c), returns an integer representing the value of the string. For example: ord(‘a’) returns the integer 97. chr(i) Returns a string of one character whose ASCII code is the integer i. For example: chr(97) returns the string ‘a’.<br>c)Enter a secret sentence and create a password by taking the last letter of each word.<br><br>Write a menu driven program called yourId_encryptor.py that will allow the user to enter commands and process these commands until the quit command is entered.<br><br><br><br></font>

For example, if the user provides the path as<br>/home/alark/cs110/labs/lab1/lab1.py, the provided ‘path’ is actually a file.<br>Alternatively, /home/alark/cs110/labs/lab1/ is a directory. Use the built-in function<br>os.path.isfile(path) in your program to identify whether a path is a file or a directory.<br>• If the path is a file, check if it is a python file. Use a string function for this. Increment the<br>counter for python files. If the file is not a python file, increment the count for all files but not<br>the count for python files. Remember, your program should count the total number of files in<br>the directory and all its subdirectories.<br>• If the path is a directory, obtain a list of all the files in that directory and call your recursive<br>function with every element in that list. Given a path, you can obtain the list of all the files in a<br>directory using files = os.listdir(path).<br>• At the end of the program, you must display the total number of python files and the total<br>number of files found.<br>Submit to your submit directory<br>Using CyberDuck or your favorite file transfer program, make a directory for lab7 in your submit<br>directory and upload:<br>• recursive_dir_traversal.py<br>• README.txt (a text description of how your program works)<br><br><br><br><br></font>

Update 12/2: clarified Grade <strong>init</strong> and<br>Student <strong>str</strong> requirements. Update 11/30: clarified specifications of <strong>init</strong> and <strong>str</strong> and added a<br>note about the sample test file).<br>Assignment Overview<br>This assignment focuses on the implementation of two Python classes to store grades of students in a<br>class.<br>It is worth 55 points (5.5% of course grade) and must be completed no later than 11:59 PM on Tuesday,<br>December 6.<br>Assignment Specifications<br>You will develop “Student” and “Grade” classes and implement all the methods described in the<br>following section.<br>You will demonstrate that your implementation of the classes are correct by developing a program<br>which serves as a test bed for that class.<br>You will develop an application program which uses those classes to read “students.txt” and “grades.txt”<br>files and store their data in instances of Student and Grade classes.<br>Assignment Deliverables<br>The deliverables for this assignment are the following files:<br>classes.py  – the source code for your Student and Grade classes<br>proj11-test.py – the source code for your test program<br>proj11-app.py – the source code for your application program<br>Be sure to use the specified file names and submit them for grading via the handin system before the<br>project deadline.<br>Specifications for Class Grade<br>1. The constructor (method <strong>init</strong>) will accept 3 values as parameters, name of the<br>assignment (string), grade and assignment weight (floats). All three parameters must have<br>default values—you choose appropriate ones. Also, the attributes cannot be private because you<br>need to access them in the Student class. That is, do not use double underscores in your names,<br>i.e. do not use an attribute name such as self.<strong>name.<br>2. The string method (</strong>str<strong>) and representation method (</strong>repr<strong>) should return a string<br>that includes the name, grade and weight of the Grade object in one line.<br>Specifications for Class Student<br>1. The constructor (method </strong>init<strong>) will accept 4 values as parameters, student id (int), first<br>name (string), last name (string), and a list of all the grade objects for that student. All three<br>parameters must have default values—you choose appropriate ones, but the appropriate default<br>value for a list parameter is None, not an empty list ([]).<br>2. add_grade method should take a Grade object as a parameter and append it to a list of grades<br>for that student.<br>3. calculate_grade should multiply all the grade points of the student by their weight and<br>return the final course grade. (Each Grade object in the list has a value and weight that should be<br>multiplied together. The sum of all the calculations results the final weighted grade of the student<br>in the course)<br>4. The string method (</strong>str<strong>) and representation method (</strong>repr<strong>) should return a string<br>that has the student’s name (with last name first with a comma between the last name and first<br>name) includes all the grades of the student. This method must call the </strong>str<strong> method of the<br>Grade objects. Note that implicitly calling the </strong>str<strong> method is fine such as str() or<br>format(), but do not access the individual attributes such as grade.name.<br>5. </strong>gt<strong>, </strong>lt<strong> and </strong>eq<strong> methods should compare the final grades of two students<br>together.<br>Note that you can use calculate_grade method to calculate the final grade of two students.<br>Never use “==” to check for equality of two float numbers (because floats are approximations<br>of real numbers). Instead, find the absolute value of the difference of two numbers; if the<br>difference is less than epsilon (a very small number such as 10**-6), the floats are equal to<br>each other (that is they are close enough to consider them to be equal). Python has an absolute<br>value function: abs()<br>Please note that you may wish to use function “print” to display various items as you are developing<br>your implementation of the class. However, all invocations of function “print” must be removed from<br>the final version of your classes (or at least turned into comments).<br>Hint: check the “Student” class in page 546 of the book for reference.<br>Specifications for the Test Program<br>1. You will develop a program to serve as a test bed for classes. That is, the only purpose of the<br>program is to demonstrate that each method of your “Student” and “Grade” classes is implemented<br>correctly. The source code for your test bed will be contained in the file named “proj11-test.py”. That<br>file will import “classes.py”. A file named “proj11-test.py” is provided as a starting template.<br>2. Your test bed will not perform any input operations. Instead, all test cases will be embedded in the<br>program itself.<br>3. The output produced by your test bed must be appropriately labeled so that the reader can understand<br>the purpose and result of each test case without examining the source code. For example, when<br>demonstrating </strong>lt<strong> you might print “Demonstrating Fred &lt; Mary” followed by<br>print(Fred&lt;Mary)<br>Specifications for the Application Program<br>1. You will develop an application program which uses both classes to solve the problem described<br>below.<br>The source code for your application program will be contained in the file named “proj11-app.py”. That<br>file will import “classes.py”.<br>2. The program will attempt to access the files named “students.txt” and “grades.txt”. If any of the<br>input files cannot be opened, the program will display an appropriate message and halt. (Since the first<br>posted version of this document didn’t specify that the program must prompt for these two file names,<br>you have the option of prompting for them or not. However, if you prompt for them, our test program<br>will provide the name grades.txt to the first prompt and students.txt to the second prompt.)<br>3. The grades.txt file will contain three or more lines. The first line contains the weight of each<br>assignment, the second line contains the labels and the name of the assignments. Line 3 and subsequent<br>lines contain grade information for a student. Each line has a student id and all the grades of a student.<br>The information of each assignment should be stored in an instance of “Grade” class. A list of Grade<br>objects should be passed to the constructor of “Student” class.<br>4. The students.txt file will contain one or more lines, where each line contains the information of a<br>student. Each line has an id, first name and last name. That information should be stored in an instance<br>of “Student” class along with the list of “Grade” objects explained above.<br>5. The application should store all “Student” objects in a list and should print them ( print(student) ) like<br>the sample output provided below.<br>6. The application should print the class average at the end.<br>Assignment Notes<br>1. You would be wise to develop your implementation of “Student” and “Grade” classes and your test<br>program incrementally and in parallel. That is, implement one class method at a time and then test that<br>method by adding statements to your test program.<br>Clearly, the first class method which must be implemented and tested is the constructor (</strong>init<strong>).<br>Perhaps the second class method to implement and test is </strong>str__ so that you have a way to display<br>the value of an object of type “Student” and “Grade” using function “print”.<br>After implementing and testing those methods, you would continue to implement and test one method at<br>a time until you have completed the class.<br>Be sure to insert and test any necessary error handling at the appropriate time.<br>2. Approximately 60% of the 55 points available for the project will be allocated to the implementation<br>of “Student” and “Grade” classes, approximately 15% will be allocated to the test program, and<br>approximately 25% will be allocated to the application program.<br>Sample Output (Application file)<br>Hopper, Grace<br>proj01 : 75% 0.07<br>proj02 : 81% 0.08<br>proj03 : 91% 0.10<br>proj04 : 87% 0.10<br>proj05 : 73% 0.15<br>exam01 : 90% 0.20<br>exam02 : 86% 0.30<br>Final grade: 84%<br>Knuth, Donald<br>proj01 : 79% 0.07<br>proj02 : 73% 0.08<br>proj03 : 83% 0.10<br>proj04 : 87% 0.10<br>proj05 : 82% 0.15<br>exam01 : 97% 0.20<br>exam02 : 99% 0.30<br>Final grade: 89%<br>Goldberg, Adele<br>proj01 : 92% 0.07<br>proj02 : 82% 0.08<br>proj03 : 92% 0.10<br>proj04 : 83% 0.10<br>proj05 : 96% 0.15<br>exam01 : 92% 0.20<br>exam02 : 93% 0.30<br>Final grade: 91%<br>Kernighan, Brian<br>proj01 : 77% 0.07<br>proj02 : 95% 0.08<br>proj03 : 98% 0.10<br>proj04 : 87% 0.10<br>proj05 : 87% 0.15<br>exam01 : 85% 0.20<br>exam02 : 82% 0.30<br>Final grade: 86%<br>Liskov, Barbara<br>proj01 : 72% 0.07<br>proj02 : 82% 0.08<br>proj03 : 98% 0.10<br>proj04 : 90% 0.10<br>proj05 : 75% 0.15<br>exam01 : 98% 0.20<br>exam02 : 94% 0.30<br>Final grade: 89%<br>The class average is 88.17%<br>========================================<br>Educational Research<br>When you have completed the project insert the 5-line comment specified below.<br>For each of the following statements, please respond with how much they apply to your experience<br>completing the programming project, on the following scale:<br>1 = Strongly disagree / Not true of me at all<br>2<br>3<br>4 = Neither agree nor disagree / Somewhat true of me<br>5<br>6<br>7 = Strongly agree / Extremely true of me<br><strong><em>Please note that your responses to these questions will not affect your project grade, so please<br>answer as honestly as possible.</em></strong><br>Q1: Upon completing the project, I felt proud/accomplished<br>Q2: While working on the project, I often felt frustrated/annoyed<br>Q3: While working on the project, I felt inadequate/stupid<br>Q4: Considering the difficulty of this course, the teacher, and my skills, I think I will do well in<br>this course.<br>Please insert your answers into the bottom of your project program as a comment, formatted exactly as<br>follows (so we can write a program to extract them).<br># Questions<br># Q1: 5<br># Q2: 3<br># Q3: 4<br># Q4: 6<br><br><br><br><br></font>
