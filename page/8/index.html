For this lab you will NOT be creating any classes of your own. In fact you can do the whole lab in the main, although I think that you will see that it is highly advisable to have at least one non-member function since there is a task that is repeated.<br>Begin by copying the file names.txt to your working directory. This file has a long list of first names, all taken from some of my classes. Briefly open it and look at it, or just skim through it with more names.txt<br><br>At the top of your program #includeas well as iostream, string, and fstream. Declare a multiset that is capable of holding strings.<br>Fill the multiset with all the names in the file. (Since there are no spaces in the names you can use &gt;&gt; or getline.)<br>Now declare an iterator that is appropriate for traversing the multiset. Set it to the beginning of the multiset full of names, and walk through the list, outputting each name it finds. (There are a lot of them, so you may want to separate them with spaces instead of putting one on each line.)<br>Run and test this program. Your name should be somewhere in the list. (Note that the names are now in alphabetical order.)<br>Here is the place where you want to pass your STL container to a non-member function, since we are doing something that is basically the same three times in a row. If you do you should pass the container by const and reference, since it is large. You will probably want one additional parameter.<br><br>Declare two iterators.<br>Move one of them through the list to the first name that begins with ‘M’. Since you know it is returning a string, you will know that (it).at(0) will return the first character in that string.<br>Now set the second iterator equal to the first. Use it to count how many M names there are in the list. Print this number out.<br>Using the second iterator, print out all the M names in reverse alphabetical order. (Remember that these are bidirectional iterators, so you –it works to go backwards.)<br>Now do the above three steps for all the ‘C’ names and then for all the ‘Q’ names.<br>If I had asked for ‘Y’ (I didn’t) the output would look like:<br>There are 3 Y names in the list<br>They are:Yujia Yuanhang Yingjie<br>This program has no user interaction. When you have it working, simply start a script file, run the program once, and close the script file.<br>Submit your source code and the script file to Blackboard.<br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>这次需要代写的Java编程作业，考察Graph的知识点，读文件构造Graph，然后按条件用BFS搜索，并最终输出结果。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>n this project, you write a program that will help you play the “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon” game. This game is played on a graph of movies and actors/actresses who starred in them. The Bacon Number is defined as follows: Kevin Bacon has a Bacon Number of 0; people who co-starred in a movie with Kevin Bacon have a Bacon Number of 1; people who co-starred in a movie with someone who has a Bacon Number of 1 in turn have a Bacon Number of 2; and so on. Given any actor/actress, the goal of the game is to establish their Bacon Number by a sequence of movies and co-stars. As shown in Figure 1, Bill Murray has a Kevin Bacon number of 1, because co-starred in “Wild Things”, while Cameron Diaz has a Kevin Bacon Number of 2, because she she co-starred with Bill Murray in “Charlie’s Angels”.<br>For example, using the “action” data set given below, we can show that “Al Pacino” has a Bacon Number<br>of 3 as follows:<br><br>Pacino, Al<br>   Heat (1995)<br>Rosales Jr., Thomas<br>   Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997)<br>Richards, Ariana<br>   Tremors (1990)<br>Bacon, Kevin<br>Kevin Bacon (0) starred in Tremors with Richards, Ariana (1) who starred in Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997) with Rosales Jr., Thomas (2) who starred in Heat (1995) with Pacino, Al (3). If we use the “all cast” data set given below, we can show that “Al Pacino” has a Bacon Number of 1 as follows:<br><br>Pacino, Al<br>   Boffo! Tinseltown’s Bombs and Blockbusters (2006)<br>Bacon, Kevin<br>Kevin Bacon (0) starred in Boffo! Tinseltown’s Bombs and Blockbusters (2006) with Pacino, Al (1). Inter- estingly this works way in the past as well:<br><br>De Rosselli, Rex<br>   Lion’s Claws, The (1918)<br>Brinley, Charles<br>   Adventure in Sahara (1938)<br>Lawrence, Marc (I)<br>   Big Easy, The (1987)<br>Goodman, John (I)<br>   Death Sentence (2007)<br>Bacon, Kevin<br>Turns out that Rex De Rosselli died in 1941 and yet he has a Bacon Number of just 4. Actually Rex really has a Bacon Number of 3 but we need to use a much bigger data set “cast.all.txt” to show this:<br><br>De Rosselli, Rex<br>   Dangerous Adventure, A (1922)<br>McCullough, Philo<br>   Chamber of Horrors (1966)<br>Danova, Cesare<br>   Animal House (1978)<br>Bacon, Kevin<br>We have included two data sets suitable for the program in the archive above (the data sets are courtesy of Robert Sedgewick):<br><br>action06.txt (4.4 MB, only action movies)<br>cast.all.txt (64 MB, all movies from the 2014 IMDB)<br>The format of these data sets is rather simple: Each line is a movie, and each movie consists of several fields separated by the “/“ character. The first field is the name of the movie itself, all the following fields are the names of actors and actresses starring in the movie. For example:<br><br>Heat (1995)/Daniels, Max/Perry, Manny/Marzan, Rick/Pacino, Al, …<br>Heat After Dark (1996)/Kitami, Toshiyuki/Sugata,…<br>Heated Vengeance (1985)/Dye, Cameron/Walker, Robert (III), …<br>Reading this data is not complicated, but we hand you the parsing code anyway so you can focus on the search algorithm instead.<br>In order to find the smallest Bacon Number for an actor we proceed as follows: First we identify the vertices for both Kevin Bacon and the actor in question (you already have that code). Then we start a breadth-first search at the vertex for Kevin Bacon; as we do this we keep track of the “previous vertex” that got us to the one we’re currently investigating. Once we find the vertex for the other actor, we are done: We just have to print out the path that got us here. This implementation of BFS is the only thing you have to write for this problem!<br>You will implement following functions in the given project:<br><br>1.Degree of separation from Kevin Bacon:<br>2.Degree of separation between any two actors/actresses:<br>3.Search actor/actress/movie:<br>4.List cast of a movie or movies of an actor/actress:<br>5.Exit<br>Select:<br>Here is what each menu item does:<br><br>Finds the Kevin Bacon number of an actor/actress<br>Find the shortest distance between any two actors/actresses.<br>Actors with same name has a Roman number after their names. You can enter the name and search the exact name in the database. For example, Emma Watson’s name appeared as “Watson, Emma (II)” in the movie database.<br>If input is a movies, it lists all the case. If the input is an actor/actress, it lists all the movies he/she<br>starred in.<br>terminate the program.<br>The “Graph” class, “Bag” class are fully implemented for you. The Graph class represents an undirected graph of vertices named 0 through V - 1. It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the graph, iterate over all of the vertices adjacent to a vertex. It also provides methods for returning the number of vertices V and the number of edges E. Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted. This implementation uses an adjacency-lists representation, which is a vertex-indexed array of Bag objects. All operations take constant time (in the worst case) except iterating over the vertices adjacent to a given vertex, which takes time proportional to the number of such vertices.<br>You will have add the mapping relationships between vertex symbols (name of a movie, actor, acres) and vertex number in “SymbolGraph” class. For example: in Graph 2, vertex 0 and vertex 5 can represent movies and other vertices represent actors/actresses. You also have to implement to methods to find the shortest path between two given vertices. All edges have the weight of 1. Therefore, you can also use BFS to find the shortest distance between two vertices.<br>Before you are sure your program is running correctly, test your code with a smaller database base. Start with a file that only has 5-10 movies and actors/actresses. If you think your program is working, then try with “action06.txt”, (4.4 MB, only action movies). To try “cast.all.txt”, 64 MB, all movies from the 2014 IMDB, 300,000 movies, 900,000 actors/actresses, you have to allocate larger memory for your project. Google it for instructions to do that. If you run your program from coo and line you specify memory size in your command line. Following command allocate 2gb memory for JVM to run KevinBacon.<br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>这次需要代写的是一个关于Stack的Lab作业，由于是Lab作业，工作量并不大，都是基本的Stack操作。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>sing Versus Extending an ADT<br><br>Note: In this and future labs we make a distinction between using an ADT and extending an ADT. You must be clear on this distinction:<br><br>Using an ADT<br><br>When asked to use an ADT write a program that is implementation independent, i.e. the program uses only ADT methods (such as those for a stack) and works for either the array or linked implementation of a data structure. Do not change any code in the ADT implementation files such as stack_array.py.<br><br>Extending an ADT<br><br>When asked to extend an ADT you are going to add new methods to an ADT, meaning that you are going to add code to one or both of the array or linked implementation of a data structure, such as stack_array.py.<br><br>The Stack ADT (Abstract Data Type)<br><br>A stack is a data structure that follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) rules. Data is added to the top of a stack and removed from the top of a stack. The Stack ADT provides methods for manipulating data in a stack.<br>A reminder of some important points of ADT use are:<br><br>No matter what the underlying implementation of the stack programs should access a stack only through these methods.<br>As a corollary to the first point, the stack can be implemented in any number of ways so long as any given implementation follows the ADT function requirements. The implementation must invisible to the program using the Stack ADT.<br>A stack may store any type of data, although all the data it stores should be of the same type.<br>The following code imports a stack class and the Food class then initializes a stack:<br><br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>from stack_array import Stack<br>from food import Food<br><br>s = Stack()<br> …<br>The line:<br><br>1<br>from stack_array import Stack<br>imports the Stack class from the library file stack_array.py. This library file can be replaced by any other file that implements the Stack ADT methods.<br>The line:<br><br>1<br>from food import Food<br>gives access to the methods in the food.py library file as above.<br>The line:<br><br>1<br>s = Stack()<br>creates a stack named s. The stack is now ready to accept data.<br><br>Project References<br><br>As we work through the term we will be creating a number of different data structures and adding more functionality to the Food library already written. Making sure that each new project has the latest version of a data structure or Food library is difficult to do if we are reduced to copying and pasting our pydev modules into each new project. Fortunately, Eclipse provides a much better mechanism to reference code. Setting up Project References allows you to link one Pydev project to another, and to use the code from one project in another with the import and from … import * statements already shown. Nothing needs to be changed in your source code.<br>To make a reference from one project to another in Eclipse, right click on a project name in the Navigator pane. From the resulting pop-up menu click on Properties and then on Project References in the resulting dialog box.<br>Click on the check box of all projects that you wish to reference from the current project. In this example the project album is already selected, and the project data_structures will be added as a reference. Once this is done all of the classes in both album and data_structures will be available through import statements.<br>A few things to keep in mind when using project references:<br><br>All referenced projects must be open when attempting to run a program.<br>Submit all referenced projects as part of your Eclipse archive (.zip) file when submitting exercises or the markers will not be able to run your programs. You may select multiple projects to include in an Eclipse archive file.<br>Do not use the same Pydev module names in two different referenced projects or Eclipse will not know which one an import statement is supposed to be referring to.<br>Project references go one way only. If the project stacks references the project data_structures, then data_structures should not reference stacks. Circular references are a very bad idea.<br>Upon occasion referenced projects may become ‘out of sync’ with the project that references them. To fix this, right-click on the project and choose Refresh to update Eclipse from the file system.<br>Array-based Stacks<br><br>The file stack_array.py is a text file containing the basic outline of the array-based Stack class. Copy this code into the Pydev module stack_array.py in your login_data_structures project (where login is your Network login). Thus, a student with the Network login barn4520 should name their projects barn4520_Food and barn4520_data_structures.)

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>用Java Swing作为GUI，从文件中读取信息并显示，实现逻辑，整体控件不多，很基础的作业。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>What to turn in<br><br>Use Export Project in NetBeans to export your project to a zip file, name it YourLastName_FirstName_project.zip. Send the file as a single attachment through Blackboard. The subject of this email is YourLastName_FirstName_project.<br><br>Note<br><br>Write your name as a comment line at the very beginning of each .java program: 1 point deducted for each file without your name at top.<br>Besides this documentation, I also provide you a text file, accounts.txt (described below). You should download this text file into the directory of your Netbeans project for your programs. Make sure when accessing this text file programmatically, your program just uses the file name without explicitly providing a path (so called relative path). For instance,<br>1<br>File accountFile = new File(“accounts.txt”);<br>For more information about the absolute path, refer to chapter 18 lecture slides. Failing to use the relative path loses 4 points.<br><br>Suggestions<br><br>Start early and start from simple – this is VERY important. For example, begin from the week when the project is available. As the first step, you construct the GUI but not implement functions for button clicks.<br>For the give function buttons, you may start to implement the Exit function first, and then the functions of Deposit and Withdraw buttons.<br>Always keep a copy of your working code before you implement more requirements.<br>Requirements in summary<br><br>1) Develop a Java GUI application that reads account information from the provided text file (accounts.txt), shows all account numbers in a JComboBox, and displays other GUI controls as shown in Fig. 1;<br>2) Exit button : Quit the application;<br>3) Deposit button: Make a deposit to a selected account;<br>4) Withdraw button: Make a withdrawal from a selected account;<br>5) Transfer To button: Make a transfer from a selected account to a beneficiary account;<br><br>Requirements in details<br><br>GUI in general<br><br>Once the program starts, it reads all account information from accounts.txt (each row in the file is a account record and is in the format of<br><br>accountNumber&lt;&gt;openDate&lt;&gt;customerName&lt;&gt;balance<br>The openDate is in the format of year/month/day.) It then fills a JComboBox with all account numbers and shows other GUI controls as in Fig. 1. Your program must be able to “read” the file of this format programmatically because when I test your project, the file content (not the format) will be changed.<br>When you select an item (account number) from the JComboBox, the corresponding values for openDate, customerName, and balance will be shown in the three read-only text fields, and the Deposit, Withdraw, and Transfer To buttons become enabled, see Fig. 2.<br><br>Exit<br><br>Clicking this button to close the frame and exit the program.<br>Instead of using mouse to click the button, pressing Alt + x will also trigger the Exit button.<br>Deposit<br><br>(After selecting an account number from the JComboBox), clicking the Deposit button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 3 asking you to enter a deposit amount for the selected account. Hint: this dialog window is generated by JOptionPane.showInputDialog().<br>If you enter a non-negative number, such as 100, the amount will be deposited to the account. See Fig 4 - the balanced is adjusted accordingly. The accounts.txt file should also be updated accordingly as well.<br>If you clicking Cancel in Fig. 3, nothing will happen to this account.<br>If an invalid deposit amount is entered in Fig. 3, such as -100 or $100, you will see an error message as shown in Fig 5.<br>Hint: this dialog window is generated by JOptionPane. showConfirmDialog().<br><br>Withdraw<br><br>(After selecting an account from the JComboBox), clicking the Withdraw button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 6 asking you to enter a withdrawal amount for the selected account.<br>If you enter a non-negative number, such as 100, and if the account balance is sufficient, the withdrawal will be made from the account successfully. See Fig. 7, the balanced is adjusted. The accounts.txt file should also be updated accordingly as well.<br>If you clicking Cancel in Fig. 6, nothing will occur to this account.<br>If an invalid withdrawal amount is entered in Fig. 6, such as -100 or $100, you will see an error message as shown in Fig 8.<br>If a withdrawal amount is greater than the balance, you show an error message and stop the withdrawal.<br>Transfer To<br><br>(After selecting an account from the JComboBox), clicking the Transfer To button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 10 asking you to enter a beneficiary account number.<br>If a valid account number (any number existing in the JComboBox) is entered, after click OK button, a window like Fig. 11 pops up asking for amount to transfer.<br>If a valid amount is entered, and the balance is not less than this amount and sometimes the sum of this transfer amount and a transfer fee, the transfer will be succeeded as shown in Fig. 12 and 13. The transfer fee is only applied to account with the balance less than $10000 which is specified in AccountConstants interface (more about AccountConstants see end of this document).<br>If an invalid beneficiary account number (i.e., a number which does not exist in the account number JComboBox) is entered in Fig. 10, Fig. 14 shows the error message.<br>If the balance is not sufficient for the transfer amount, Fig. 15 shows the error message.<br>If the balance is not sufficient to cover both transfer amount and transfer fee (when such a fee applies), Fig. 16 shows the error message.<br>Design requirements<br><br>You must have the following five classes (at least 5 points deduction for missing a required class).<br><br>AccountConstants – contains two constants, CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD (value is 10000) and TRANSFER_FEE (value is 2.0). For this project, the business rule is as follows:<br>When making a transfer to a beneficiary account, if the balance of the transferring account is less than CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD, TRANSFER_FEE is deducted from the balance after the transfer is made. If the balance is not sufficient to cover both CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD and TRANSFER_FEE (if the fee applies), the transfer should not be made. If the balance of transferring account is not less than CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD, TRANSFER_FEE is waived for this transfer.<br>Account – transferTo() method is abstract. deposit() and withdraw() are not abstract. If you need, feel free to define other methods, such as getBalance(), in the Account class.<br>CheckingAccount: extends Account and implements the transferTo method (refer to the above diagram). The returned value of transferTo method is defined as follows.<br>return 0: transfer successful and without transfer fee<br>return 1: transfer successful and with the transfer fee applied<br>return -1: transfer unsuccessful because balance is less than transfer amount and transfer fee<br>return -2: transfer unsuccessful because balance is less than transfer amount<br>AccountUtility – reads accounts.txt file, updates the file, and provides data for other programs.<br>AccountApp – is the only Java program having the main method. This must be the only file with a main method. If not, you lose 5 points.<br>Depending on your design and it’s your decision that you may have more Java programs than those specified above.<br></font>

This time period is colloquially known as funball season. The goal of funball is to score the most points. Many cities have their own funball teams and compete in the NFL. Despite the name, funball is very serious and the games are extremely competitive.<br>In June after the regular season, the NFL hosts a single-elimination tournament to determine the best funball team. Win or go home! The winner gets a year’s worth of bragging rights and claim to a rotating trophy.<br>In an attempt to make the tournament as exciting as possible, the NFL pairs stronger teams with weaker teams in the early rounds expecting that only the best teams will be left at the end of the tournament. The process of ranking teams is called seeding. Lower seed values indicate stronger teams.<br>For logistical reasons, the tournament is broken into 4 regions: N, S, E, and W.<br>The tournament is so popular that several derived games have appeared. Among the most popular is a pick’em challenge where players attempt to pick all of the winners in the tournament before any tournament games are played. In recent years, the pick’em challenge has been hosted by Sanguine Bank which offered a million dollar prize to anyone who could pick all of the correct teams.<br><br>Questions<br><br>Let p(A) be the winning percentage of team A and p B be the winning percentage of team B. Assume we use the formula 1 to estimate the probability that A wins in a matchup against B.<br><br>P(A wins|A and B play) = p(A)(1 - p(B)) / p(A)(1 - p(B)) + (1 - p(A))p(B)<br>Using this formula, which year’s tournament results had the highest probability?<br>To answer this question, please use the attached data.<br><br>regular season results.csv<br>seasons.csv<br>teams.csv<br>tourney results.csv<br>tourney seeds.csv<br>tourney slots.csv<br>Sanguine Bank has decided that the payout of the pick’em challenge is too risky. They contacted Auspicious Insurance Group (AIG) for a quote on a special insurance contract that covers the payout from the challenge. How much should AIG charge Sanguine Bank for the insurance<br>contract? It is sufficient to explain your approach; no code or amounts are required for this question.<br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>代写一个比较炫酷的3D的游戏，本质上其实还是在2D上的Grid运算，只不过GUI方面提供了3D的渲染引擎。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>For your first assignment you’ll be implementing a simple colour matching game inspired by the Bejeweled series and creatively titled “Colour Match”. The game revolves around finding groups of the same colour on a 3D grid of cubes. The basic gameplay is as follows:<br><br>When the game starts a grid of random colours will appear on screen.<br>In a separate section of the screen, the player will be shown a random colour – this is known as the “Next Colour”.<br>Using the arrow keys, the player will select one of the cubes on the grid and when they press the spacebar key, the colour of the selected cube will change to match the “Next Colour”.<br>If the change in colour causes three or more cubes of the same colour to be “connected”, those cubes are removed from the screen and the player’s score is increased (the amount of score increase is up to you, but they should get bigger scores for matching larger amounts of cubes).<br>After the matched cubes are removed, cubes above them on the grid should move down to fill their place (there should never be any holes in the board). New cubes should also appear along the top of the board to fill the place of any cubes which fell down to a lower row.<br>After the cubes are removed, the “Next Colour” is randomised again and the player can pick another cube to replace.<br>When the game ends, a game over screen should be displayed which tells the player their final score. A quit and a restart button should also be present on this screen.<br>The end condition of the game is controlled by two things:<br><br>If a move doesn’t result in a match of three or more connected cubes, a life is lost. After losing three lives, the game ends.<br>A move counter should also be included which limits the amount of allowed moves per game. The player should be able to see the amount of moves remaining somewhere in the UI.<br>To spice up the gameplay, a special Power Cube should be included, as outlined below:<br><br>When the player selects a cube on the grid and activates the power cube with the P key, every cube on the grid that matches the selected colour should be removed from the board.<br>The score rewarded should be based on the amount of cubes that were removed.<br>The power cube is available from the start of the game and can only be used once - use it wisely!<br>Defining “Connected”<br><br>There are a few options for what we consider “connected” to mean. You can attempt one of the three options presented below depending on the grade you’re targeting.<br><br>To receive a pass for the criterion “Are matching cubes correctly identified?”, you should look for matching colours in the immediate four neighbors. In the below images, the dark grey tile is the selected cell for the current turn, and the light grey are matching colours which should be removed.<br>To receive a medium grade, you should look for lines of the same colour originating from the selected cell on any of its four sides.<br>To be eligible for full marks, you should keep stepping through neighbours and find chunks of the same colour.<br>Provided Assets<br><br>Provided inside the Assignment 1 Assets file on Moodle are all the assets you’ll need to create the game. The cubes have a width and length of one unit allowing for easier placement. It is recommended you build your solution off the Week 3 Base Code (while waiting for that code to be released, you should spend week two thinking about your solution).<br>Please note that while additional assets may be included, they won’t be considered when marking.<br>Only your C++ code and the quality of your gameplay will be assessed (we’re not marking your modelling skills).<br><br><br><br></font>

Ann could hold and score 5<br>points, but chooses to roll again. Ann rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but<br>chooses to roll again. Ann rolls a 1, and must end her turn without scoring. The next player,<br>Bob, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which he chooses to hold, and adds his turn total of 22<br>points to his score.<br>The implementation should exercise the object-oriented design aspects and good<br>practices for design and implementation.<br>entities that must be realised as C++ classes.<br>attributes for each of these entities.<br>Identify the methods that may be useful for each of these entities.<br>• By carefully considering the rules of the game, implement the classes for your entities.<br>Pay special attention to the interaction between classes and annotate your<br>implementation using useful comments.<br>• Design you classes to be reusable for part 1 and part 2<br>Part one of assignment<br>Program a multi-player version of the game that allows a number of players to compete<br>against each other.<br>Part two of assignment<br>(Reusing the classes from the multiplayer game)<br>Develop automated players that use at least two strategies (e.g. hold after a fixed number of<br>throws, hold after a fixed gain of points)<br>Write a code that automatically runs the automated players against each other and use<br>statistics to compare the strategies.<br>2016/17  ELEC362 - Application Development using C++  2<br>Submission<br>Please submit your report and the source code (zipped project for both parts) on VITAL.<br>In the report you will outline your design process by describing what classes you use, what<br>attributes and methods they contain and give an overview how they intact.<br>Please copy your source code at the end of the report. (When pasting code in Word choose<br>‘Past Options/Keep Source formatting’ to keep the colour coded formatting used in Visual<br>Studio.)<br><br><br><br></font>
