        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>用Java Swing作为GUI，从文件中读取信息并显示，实现逻辑，整体控件不多，很基础的作业。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>What to turn in<br><br>Use Export Project in NetBeans to export your project to a zip file, name it YourLastName_FirstName_project.zip. Send the file as a single attachment through Blackboard. The subject of this email is YourLastName_FirstName_project.<br><br>Note<br><br>Write your name as a comment line at the very beginning of each .java program: 1 point deducted for each file without your name at top.<br>Besides this documentation, I also provide you a text file, accounts.txt (described below). You should download this text file into the directory of your Netbeans project for your programs. Make sure when accessing this text file programmatically, your program just uses the file name without explicitly providing a path (so called relative path). For instance,<br>1<br>File accountFile = new File(“accounts.txt”);<br>For more information about the absolute path, refer to chapter 18 lecture slides. Failing to use the relative path loses 4 points.<br><br>Suggestions<br><br>Start early and start from simple – this is VERY important. For example, begin from the week when the project is available. As the first step, you construct the GUI but not implement functions for button clicks.<br>For the give function buttons, you may start to implement the Exit function first, and then the functions of Deposit and Withdraw buttons.<br>Always keep a copy of your working code before you implement more requirements.<br>Requirements in summary<br><br>1) Develop a Java GUI application that reads account information from the provided text file (accounts.txt), shows all account numbers in a JComboBox, and displays other GUI controls as shown in Fig. 1;<br>2) Exit button : Quit the application;<br>3) Deposit button: Make a deposit to a selected account;<br>4) Withdraw button: Make a withdrawal from a selected account;<br>5) Transfer To button: Make a transfer from a selected account to a beneficiary account;<br><br>Requirements in details<br><br>GUI in general<br><br>Once the program starts, it reads all account information from accounts.txt (each row in the file is a account record and is in the format of<br><br>accountNumber&lt;&gt;openDate&lt;&gt;customerName&lt;&gt;balance<br>The openDate is in the format of year/month/day.) It then fills a JComboBox with all account numbers and shows other GUI controls as in Fig. 1. Your program must be able to “read” the file of this format programmatically because when I test your project, the file content (not the format) will be changed.<br>When you select an item (account number) from the JComboBox, the corresponding values for openDate, customerName, and balance will be shown in the three read-only text fields, and the Deposit, Withdraw, and Transfer To buttons become enabled, see Fig. 2.<br><br>Exit<br><br>Clicking this button to close the frame and exit the program.<br>Instead of using mouse to click the button, pressing Alt + x will also trigger the Exit button.<br>Deposit<br><br>(After selecting an account number from the JComboBox), clicking the Deposit button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 3 asking you to enter a deposit amount for the selected account. Hint: this dialog window is generated by JOptionPane.showInputDialog().<br>If you enter a non-negative number, such as 100, the amount will be deposited to the account. See Fig 4 - the balanced is adjusted accordingly. The accounts.txt file should also be updated accordingly as well.<br>If you clicking Cancel in Fig. 3, nothing will happen to this account.<br>If an invalid deposit amount is entered in Fig. 3, such as -100 or $100, you will see an error message as shown in Fig 5.<br>Hint: this dialog window is generated by JOptionPane. showConfirmDialog().<br><br>Withdraw<br><br>(After selecting an account from the JComboBox), clicking the Withdraw button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 6 asking you to enter a withdrawal amount for the selected account.<br>If you enter a non-negative number, such as 100, and if the account balance is sufficient, the withdrawal will be made from the account successfully. See Fig. 7, the balanced is adjusted. The accounts.txt file should also be updated accordingly as well.<br>If you clicking Cancel in Fig. 6, nothing will occur to this account.<br>If an invalid withdrawal amount is entered in Fig. 6, such as -100 or $100, you will see an error message as shown in Fig 8.<br>If a withdrawal amount is greater than the balance, you show an error message and stop the withdrawal.<br>Transfer To<br><br>(After selecting an account from the JComboBox), clicking the Transfer To button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 10 asking you to enter a beneficiary account number.<br>If a valid account number (any number existing in the JComboBox) is entered, after click OK button, a window like Fig. 11 pops up asking for amount to transfer.<br>If a valid amount is entered, and the balance is not less than this amount and sometimes the sum of this transfer amount and a transfer fee, the transfer will be succeeded as shown in Fig. 12 and 13. The transfer fee is only applied to account with the balance less than $10000 which is specified in AccountConstants interface (more about AccountConstants see end of this document).<br>If an invalid beneficiary account number (i.e., a number which does not exist in the account number JComboBox) is entered in Fig. 10, Fig. 14 shows the error message.<br>If the balance is not sufficient for the transfer amount, Fig. 15 shows the error message.<br>If the balance is not sufficient to cover both transfer amount and transfer fee (when such a fee applies), Fig. 16 shows the error message.<br>Design requirements<br><br>You must have the following five classes (at least 5 points deduction for missing a required class).<br><br>AccountConstants – contains two constants, CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD (value is 10000) and TRANSFER_FEE (value is 2.0). For this project, the business rule is as follows:<br>When making a transfer to a beneficiary account, if the balance of the transferring account is less than CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD, TRANSFER_FEE is deducted from the balance after the transfer is made. If the balance is not sufficient to cover both CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD and TRANSFER_FEE (if the fee applies), the transfer should not be made. If the balance of transferring account is not less than CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD, TRANSFER_FEE is waived for this transfer.<br>Account – transferTo() method is abstract. deposit() and withdraw() are not abstract. If you need, feel free to define other methods, such as getBalance(), in the Account class.<br>CheckingAccount: extends Account and implements the transferTo method (refer to the above diagram). The returned value of transferTo method is defined as follows.<br>return 0: transfer successful and without transfer fee<br>return 1: transfer successful and with the transfer fee applied<br>return -1: transfer unsuccessful because balance is less than transfer amount and transfer fee<br>return -2: transfer unsuccessful because balance is less than transfer amount<br>AccountUtility – reads accounts.txt file, updates the file, and provides data for other programs.<br>AccountApp – is the only Java program having the main method. This must be the only file with a main method. If not, you lose 5 points.<br>Depending on your design and it’s your decision that you may have more Java programs than those specified above.<br></font>

Comment all variables to the right of each declaration. Declare only one variable per line.<br>Notice that several programs (see program 2-9 on pages 74-75) in the programming text use a single line comment to indicate the start of the local declaration and executable statement sections of the main function.<br>At no point during the semester should these two sections ever overlap. You might consider adopting this habit of commenting the start of each section to help you avoid this mistake.<br>Select meaningful identifiers (names) for all variables and functions in your program.<br>Indent all code found within the main and all user-defined functions exactly two spaces.<br>Control-forcing statements such as exit, break, continue, and the use of multiple return statements in a single function are not acceptable practices according to course standards.<br>Do not single (or double) space the entire program, use blank lines when appropriate.<br>Consider making symbolic/defined constants to represent those values that do not change during the execution of the program.<br>There is no need to include example output with your submission.<br>Remove any diagnostic print statements from your code, even if they are commented out (inactive), unless you believe your program to be logically incorrect or incomplete as a way to demonstrate to your lab instructor how much of the problem you were able to solve and attempted to implement.<br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>这次需要代写的作业比较有意思，根据提供的历史数据中，各场比赛的得分情况，来预测本次球赛的每个球队的胜率。<br>类似世界杯赛场的大数据预测，不过作业的模型和公式要简单许多。<br>最终冠军和初始分组有关，事实上并没有一支球队能够稳拿冠军，每次模拟的结果都不同。<br>程序语言不限，甚至允许用Objective-C, Perl以及Ruby来写。选择用Python因为编写和调试方便。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>FThe National Funball League (NFL) runs a series of funball games each year. This time period is colloquially known as funball season. The goal of funball is to score the most points. Many cities have their own funball teams and compete in the NFL. Despite the name, funball is very serious and the games are extremely competitive.<br>In June after the regular season, the NFL hosts a single-elimination tournament to determine the best funball team. Win or go home! The winner gets a year’s worth of bragging rights and claim to a rotating trophy.<br>In an attempt to make the tournament as exciting as possible, the NFL pairs stronger teams with weaker teams in the early rounds expecting that only the best teams will be left at the end of the tournament. The process of ranking teams is called seeding. Lower seed values indicate stronger teams.<br>For logistical reasons, the tournament is broken into 4 regions: N, S, E, and W.<br>The tournament is so popular that several derived games have appeared. Among the most popular is a pick’em challenge where players attempt to pick all of the winners in the tournament before any tournament games are played. In recent years, the pick’em challenge has been hosted by Sanguine Bank which offered a million dollar prize to anyone who could pick all of the correct teams.<br><br>Questions<br><br>Let p(A) be the winning percentage of team A and p B be the winning percentage of team B. Assume we use the formula 1 to estimate the probability that A wins in a matchup against B.<br><br>P(A wins|A and B play) = p(A)(1 - p(B)) / p(A)(1 - p(B)) + (1 - p(A))p(B)<br>Using this formula, which year’s tournament results had the highest probability?<br>To answer this question, please use the attached data.<br><br>regular season results.csv<br>seasons.csv<br>teams.csv<br>tourney results.csv<br>tourney seeds.csv<br>tourney slots.csv<br>Sanguine Bank has decided that the payout of the pick’em challenge is too risky. They contacted Auspicious Insurance Group (AIG) for a quote on a special insurance contract that covers the payout from the challenge. How much should AIG charge Sanguine Bank for the insurance<br>contract? It is sufficient to explain your approach; no code or amounts are required for this question.<br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>代写一个比较炫酷的3D的游戏，本质上其实还是在2D上的Grid运算，只不过GUI方面提供了3D的渲染引擎。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>For your first assignment you’ll be implementing a simple colour matching game inspired by the Bejeweled series and creatively titled “Colour Match”. The game revolves around finding groups of the same colour on a 3D grid of cubes. The basic gameplay is as follows:<br><br>When the game starts a grid of random colours will appear on screen.<br>In a separate section of the screen, the player will be shown a random colour – this is known as the “Next Colour”.<br>Using the arrow keys, the player will select one of the cubes on the grid and when they press the spacebar key, the colour of the selected cube will change to match the “Next Colour”.<br>If the change in colour causes three or more cubes of the same colour to be “connected”, those cubes are removed from the screen and the player’s score is increased (the amount of score increase is up to you, but they should get bigger scores for matching larger amounts of cubes).<br>After the matched cubes are removed, cubes above them on the grid should move down to fill their place (there should never be any holes in the board). New cubes should also appear along the top of the board to fill the place of any cubes which fell down to a lower row.<br>After the cubes are removed, the “Next Colour” is randomised again and the player can pick another cube to replace.<br>When the game ends, a game over screen should be displayed which tells the player their final score. A quit and a restart button should also be present on this screen.<br>The end condition of the game is controlled by two things:<br><br>If a move doesn’t result in a match of three or more connected cubes, a life is lost. After losing three lives, the game ends.<br>A move counter should also be included which limits the amount of allowed moves per game. The player should be able to see the amount of moves remaining somewhere in the UI.<br>To spice up the gameplay, a special Power Cube should be included, as outlined below:<br><br>When the player selects a cube on the grid and activates the power cube with the P key, every cube on the grid that matches the selected colour should be removed from the board.<br>The score rewarded should be based on the amount of cubes that were removed.<br>The power cube is available from the start of the game and can only be used once - use it wisely!<br>Defining “Connected”<br><br>There are a few options for what we consider “connected” to mean. You can attempt one of the three options presented below depending on the grade you’re targeting.<br><br>To receive a pass for the criterion “Are matching cubes correctly identified?”, you should look for matching colours in the immediate four neighbors. In the below images, the dark grey tile is the selected cell for the current turn, and the light grey are matching colours which should be removed.<br>To receive a medium grade, you should look for lines of the same colour originating from the selected cell on any of its four sides.<br>To be eligible for full marks, you should keep stepping through neighbours and find chunks of the same colour.<br>Provided Assets<br><br>Provided inside the Assignment 1 Assets file on Moodle are all the assets you’ll need to create the game. The cubes have a width and length of one unit allowing for easier placement. It is recommended you build your solution off the Week 3 Base Code (while waiting for that code to be released, you should spend week two thinking about your solution).<br>Please note that while additional assets may be included, they won’t be considered when marking.<br>Only your C++ code and the quality of your gameplay will be assessed (we’re not marking your modelling skills).<br><br><br><br></font>

Ann could hold and score 5<br>points, but chooses to roll again. Ann rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but<br>chooses to roll again. Ann rolls a 1, and must end her turn without scoring. The next player,<br>Bob, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which he chooses to hold, and adds his turn total of 22<br>points to his score.<br>The implementation should exercise the object-oriented design aspects and good<br>practices for design and implementation.<br>entities that must be realised as C++ classes.<br>attributes for each of these entities.<br>Identify the methods that may be useful for each of these entities.<br>• By carefully considering the rules of the game, implement the classes for your entities.<br>Pay special attention to the interaction between classes and annotate your<br>implementation using useful comments.<br>• Design you classes to be reusable for part 1 and part 2<br>Part one of assignment<br>Program a multi-player version of the game that allows a number of players to compete<br>against each other.<br>Part two of assignment<br>(Reusing the classes from the multiplayer game)<br>Develop automated players that use at least two strategies (e.g. hold after a fixed number of<br>throws, hold after a fixed gain of points)<br>Write a code that automatically runs the automated players against each other and use<br>statistics to compare the strategies.<br>2016/17  ELEC362 - Application Development using C++  2<br>Submission<br>Please submit your report and the source code (zipped project for both parts) on VITAL.<br>In the report you will outline your design process by describing what classes you use, what<br>attributes and methods they contain and give an overview how they intact.<br>Please copy your source code at the end of the report.

The games have been<br>scheduled to begin on Saturday 3rd December 2016, competitors are busy training and now it’s time<br>to prepare to sell spectator tickets.<br>Your task is to design, develop and test a small application for recording ticket sales to this event.<br>Stage 1: Design<br>This stage requires you to prepare documentation that describes the function of the program and how<br>it is to be tested. There is no coding or code testing involved in this stage. A document template has<br>been provided for your use.<br>Requirements:<br>1) Read through Stage 2: Program Development to obtain details of the requirements of this<br>program.<br>2) Write an algorithm that describes how the program will operate.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced – must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. The algorithm must be structured logically so that the program would function correctly.<br>3) Prepare and document test cases that can be used to check that the program works correctly,<br>once it has been coded. You do NOT need to actually run the test cases in this stage; this will<br>occur in Stage 3: Testing.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced, must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. Make sure the test cases include checking of data entered by the user to make sure that<br>only valid data is accepted. If the user enters invalid data, the user should be informed of<br>this and given another chance to enter the data. NB: As we have not covered exception<br>handling, you may assume that the user will always enter an integer.<br>c. Test cases should be documented using a template like the one below. You may include<br>extra information if you wish. At this stage, the Actual Result column will be left blank.<br>Test Case  Expected Result  Actual Result<br>The user selects to purchase Tier 1<br>tickets.<br>The user is prompted to<br>enter the number of<br>tickets to purchase.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 3 of 9<br>Stage 2: Program Development<br>Using the Design Documentation to assist you, develop a Java program that records spectator ticket<br>sales at the gate for the Federation University Australia Olympic Games, implementing the<br>requirements outlined in this section. These requirements have been broken into three groups:<br>  Base Functionality includes the minimal level of requirements to achieve the essential<br>components of this assignment. This group of requirements focuses on getting the code to<br>work and on using the programming constructs we cover in class. You can expect to use<br>constants, variables, loops, conditional statements and arithmetic operators for these<br>requirements and you should look for opportunities to use these wherever you can. You will not<br>receive full marks for implementing a requirement, even if it works, if you have not used the<br>appropriate programming construct to do so.<br>At this level, you can decide if it is easier for you to code everything within a single method, or<br>to modularize it straight away.<br>  Standard Functionality ensures the code is modularized, and that method calls are used to<br>ensure the program flows correctly. It allows data to pass from one method to another as<br>parameters. It also includes providing a running total of tickets within an order, which is not<br>essential for getting the program to work, but is useful information for the user to see.<br>  Advanced Functionality provides a challenge task, and is best left until all the other requirements<br>have been addressed. It requires looking at a Java API to find out how to use a class we have<br>not covered in the course, and using this to provide a countdown of days remaining until the<br>games commence.<br>All three groups require that you follow coding conventions, such as proper layout of code, using<br>naming conventions and writing meaningful comments throughout your program.<br>Base Functionality:<br>1. Display a welcome message when the program starts<br>  The welcome message should have a row of asterisks at the top and the bottom, just long<br>enough to extend over the text. Hint: Use a For loop for this.<br>  The first line of the message should read “FEDERATION UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIA<br>OLYMPICS” and be approximately centred in the row of asterisks by printing white space<br>first. Hint: Can you modify the For loop from the previous step to print the white spaces?<br>  A second line of the message should be blank.<br>  The third line should read “Developed by” followed by your name and a comma, then “<br>student ID ”, then your student id, then finally “ for ITECH1000 Sem 2 2016”.<br>  The fourth line should be blank.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 4 of 9<br>2. Provide a menu from which the user can select to Purchase Tickets, View Ticket Sales or Exit.<br>This menu should be repeated each time after the user has chosen and completed an option until<br>the user chooses to Exit. The user selects an option by entering the number next to it. If an<br>invalid number is selected, the user is advised and shown the menu again to make another<br>selection.<br>3. When the user selects the Purchase Tickets option, provide another menu from which the user<br>can select Tier 1 Tickets, Tier 2 Tickets, Finalise Order or Cancel Order. The user selects an<br>option by entering the number next to it. If an invalid number is selected, the user is advised and<br>shown the menu again to make another selection.<br>a. Should the user select Tier 1 Tickets or Tier 2 Tickets, they are prompted to enter the<br>Number of Tickets required. After entering the number of tickets required, they are<br>returned to the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that they may choose to purchase additional<br>tickets. The user may not choose to purchase a negative number of tickets, but a<br>purchase of 0 tickets is permitted.<br>b. Should the user select Finalise Order:<br>i. The sale is processed by displaying the number of each type of ticket purchased<br>and the total cost of the tickets in this order. A Tier 1 ticket costs $18.50; a Tier 2<br>ticket costs $11.25.<br>ii. A record is kept of the total cost of tickets sold, the total number of Tier 1 tickets<br>sold and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold. This is a combined total from all<br>orders; there is no need to keep a record of the number of tickets in each<br>individual order.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 5 of 9<br>iii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>c. Should the user select Cancel Order:<br>i. The order is cancelled and a message displayed to confirm this to the user.<br>ii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>4. When the user selects the View Ticket Sales option, display the total value of ticket sales and both<br>the total number of Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold across ALL orders.<br>Highlight this message display with a row of 50 asterisks before and after the message. After the<br>final row of asterisks, redisplay the menu from Step 2.<br>5. When the user selects Exit System, quit the program with a message to the user.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 6 of 9<br>Standard Functionality:<br>6. Update the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that a running total of tickets included in an order is<br>displayed until the order is finalized<br>7. Modularize the code, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods as<br>parameters.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>8. Update the Welcome Message to include a countdown of the number of days to go until the<br>games begin.<br>a. Use the GregorianCalendar class to manage your dates. You will need to import<br>java.util.GregorianCalendar to use this library.<br>b. The countdown must be calculated based on the number of days between the time the<br>program runs, and Saturday 3rd December 2016. It should also be possible to just update<br>the date within the code and have the countdown automatically recalculate the number of<br>days until the games commence.<br>c. There is no pre-defined method for finding the difference between two dates in this library.<br>You will need to develop your own, using the features of the GregorianCalendar class.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 7 of 9<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Using a copy of the test cases developed in Stage 1: Design, test the program you have developed in<br>Stage 2: Program Development. Document your results, including both failed and successful tests.<br>Note: Please do not leave out any failed tests. If your testing highlights that your program has not<br>worked correctly, then the failed tests help to demonstrate that you have been testing your program<br>properly.<br>To show that you have tested your program, include small (but readable) screen captures in your<br>Actual Results as well as any explanatory comments. Microsoft Windows includes a Snipping Tool<br>that is useful for taking captures of the relevant parts of the screen.<br>You may test your program in phases if you wish. Stage 2: Program Development provides three<br>separate groups of functionality in the requirements, working from the minimal level of requirements<br>through to more advanced concepts. Each of these groups can be tested individually.<br>Base Functionality:<br>This phase requires you to check that the base functions (displaying welcome message when the<br>program starts, showing a menu of options until the user chooses to exit, purchasing tickets, viewing<br>ticket sales and exiting the system) have been implemented.<br>Standard Functionality:<br>In addition to the Base Functionality, this section includes displaying a running total of tickets that have<br>been added to an order until such time as the order has been finalized. This new functionality must<br>also be tested.<br>If you originally wrote and tested the Base Functionality by including all the code in a single method,<br>this phase also requires that you modularize your code, and use method calls and pass data between<br>methods to ensure your program still runs correctly. This means all your code will need to be re-<br>tested to ensure that all the previous functionality still works.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>This phase requires testing the code that calculates and displays the number of days until the games<br>comments in the welcoming message shown when the program starts.<br>Submission<br>Your program code and testing documentation should be zipped into a single file and loaded into the<br>Assignment Box provided in Moodle by the due date and time.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 8 of 9<br>Marking Criteria/Rubric<br>Task<br>Available<br>Marks<br>Student<br>Mark<br>Stage 1: Design Documentation<br>Development of an algorithm describing how the program should function<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Logical structure  1<br>Documented test cases to validate program<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Data is validated to ensure user entries are appropriate and incorrect user entries<br>are handled smoothly<br>1<br>Stage 2: Program Development<br>A Java program addressing the requirements outlined in the Assignment Details section,<br>including appropriate use of loops, conditional statements, constants and variables:<br>Use of coding conventions throughout entire program, including readable and clear layout,<br>following naming conventions and including meaningful and appropriate comments.<br>1<br>Base Functionality:<br>  Display of a welcome message when the program starts  1<br>  Menu displayed until user chooses to exit  1<br>  Purchase Tickets option to select and order a user-selected combination of Tier 1<br>and Tier 2 tickets<br>2<br>  View Ticket Sales to display the total value of ticket sales and both the total number<br>of Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold<br>1<br>  Exit System to quit the program with a message to the user  1<br>Standard Functionality:<br>  Running total of tickets included in an order displayed in the Purchase Tickets menu<br>until the order is finalised<br>1<br>  Code modularized, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods  2<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>  Countdown of days to go until the games commence included in the welcome<br>message<br>3<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Documented test results clearly showing all the testing that has been conducted and the<br>results of this testing.<br>  Testing of base functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of standard functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of advanced functionality<br>1<br>Total  20<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 9 of 9<br>Feedback<br>Assignments will be marked within 2 weeks of submission.

Learning Goals<br>Learn how to<br>1. use associative containers like ​std::unordered_set​ and ​std::unordered_map<br>2. use iterators to iterate through associative containers<br>3. use ​algorithms​ that are available in the C++ Standard Library<br>4. pass command line arguments to a C++ program<br>5. partition a C++ program in header files (.hpp) and source files (.cpp)<br>6. read, understand, and use code written by other people<br>2. Description<br>In this assignment you’ll be doing the following:<br>1. Read a raw text file containing movie reviews and ratings.<br>2. Remove the punctuations and stopwords (e.g. is, and, the, etc.) from the reviews and<br>write the contents to a clean review file.<br>3. Associate a value for all words found in the clean reviews based on the average rating of<br>the word.<br>4. Using the map between the words and their associated values, rate reviews from<br>another file that doesn’t have any rating already.<br>5. Write the ratings of the reviews to an output file.<br>2.1. Clean the data<br>The raw data with the reviews and the rating will be present in a file named<br>rawReviewRatings.txt​. Every review is given a rating between 0 - 4 (both inclusive). The<br>following are interpretation of the rating values:<br>● 0 = Negative<br>● 1 = Somewhat Negative<br>● 2 = Neutral<br>● 3 = Somewhat Positive<br>● 4 = Positive<br>Each line of review follows the following format:<br><rating> <review><br>Example:<br>4 The Jungle Book is awesome!<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>where 4 is the rating and the text “The Jungle Book is awesome!” is the review.<br>Now, your first task is to read the contents of this file and ​clean the data!<br>The following steps needs to be performed in the same order for cleaning the data:<br>1. Read the raw reviews from an input file. e.g. ​rawReviewRatings.txt<br>2. Replace the hyphens in every line of text with spaces.<br>e.g. If the review contains the word “awe-inspiring”, then it should be split into 2 words<br>namely “awe” and “inspiring”<br>3. Split each line of text into multiple words using the space character as the delimiter.<br>e.g. “The Jungle Book is awesome!” becomes | “The” | “Jungle” | “Book” | “is” |<br>“awesome!” |<br>4. Remove the punctuation marks from the words.<br>e.g. “awesome!” becomes “awesome” and “!” becomes “”<br>5. If there are any trailing/leading whitespaces, then remove them. Remember that the<br>space character (‘ ’), tab (‘\t’), newline (‘\n’), etc. are considered as whitespaces. For a<br>complete list of whitespace characters ​this​.<br>e.g. “zootopia ” becomes “zootopia”, “hello\t” becomes “hello”, and “world\n” becomes<br>“world”<br>6. Remove the empty words. i.e. words with length == 0.<br>7. Remove single lettered words. i.e. words with length == 1.<br>8. Remove stopwords. e.g. is, and, the, etc. The list of stopwords can be found in the file<br>stopwords.txt<br>9. Write the contents of the clean data to a file named ​cleanReviewRatings.txt​.<br>2.2. Fill the dictionary<br>Using the ​cleanReviewRatings.txt file, create a map/dictionary for every word that is found in<br>this file. The dictionary is of type<br>​<br>std::unordered_map<string, std::pair<long,="" long="">&gt;.<br>We associate a pair of values for each word namely its total_rating and its total_count. For<br>example, the word “fantastic” has occurred 3 times in the file ​cleanReviewRatings.txt with<br>associated ratings of 3, 4, and 3 (see the last 3 lines in the file). Therefore the word “fantastic”<br>gets a total_rating of 10 (i.e. 3 + 4 + 3 = 10) and a total_count of 3 since it had occurred 3 times<br>in the file. In a similar way, the other entries in this map are filled up as shown below. You may<br>want to read about a ​std::pair​ to understand more about how this map is organized.<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>word total_rating total_count<br>fantastic  10  3<br>Zootopia  3  1<br>Dory  1  1<br>Finding  1  1<br>worst  0  1<br>The  6  2<br>inspiring  2  1<br>Jungle  8  2<br>Book  8  2<br>good  1  1<br>Jack  0  1<br>awesome  4  1<br>Lion  5  2<br>King  5  2<br>awe  2  1<br>Jill  0  1<br>2.3. Rate new reviews<br>Using the map/dictionary that we created in the previous step, we are going to read new unrated<br>reviews from a file (e.g. ​rawReviews.txt​) and predict a rating for each review in this file. The<br>predicted rating for each review is written to an output file named ​ratings.txt​.<br>How do we predict the ratings for the unrated reviews?<br>1. Read the input file with the unrated raw reviews (e.g. ​rawReviews.txt​).<br>2. Clean the data and produce an output file named ​cleanReviews.txt​. The process for<br>cleaning the data is exactly the same as we did in step 2.1.<br>3. Rate each review by finding the rating for each word from the map/dictionary that we<br>created in step 2.2. The rating for a line of review is the average value of the rating of all<br>the words in the review. If some word in this unrated review is not found in the<br>map/dictionary, then that word is given a neutral rating of 2. If a review is empty (i.e. the<br>review contains no words in it), then such a review is also given a neutral rating of 2.<br>e.g. Let see how we computed the rating for the 2nd review in ​cleanReviews.txt (i.e.<br>“The Lion King fantastic”). We lookup the map/dictionary that we created before and get<br>the average rating for each word in this review. The average ratings of each word in this<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>review is shown below:<br>The: 6/2 = 3<br>Lion: 5/2 = 2.5<br>King: 5/2 = 2.5<br>fantastic: 10/3 = 3.33<br>Based on these individual values, this line gets and average review of 2.83 as shown in<br>the file ​ratings.txt​.<br>Rating for this line = (3 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 3.33) / 4 = 2.83<br>We are dividing by 4 since this review contains 4 words in total.<br>Another example: “Finding Nemo great”<br>Finding: 1<br>Nemo: 2 (because it is NOT found in the map)<br>great: 2 (because it is also NOT found in the map)<br>Rating for this line = (1 + 2 + 2) / 3 = 1.67<br>4. Write the ratings for all the reviews to an output file named ​ratings.txt​.<br>A high-level process diagram of the steps explained in 2.1 - 2.3 is shown. Hope this<br>visualization helps you to understand the idea in a better way! :)<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>That’s it! Now, after completing this step you may pat yourself on the back for doing an amazing<br>job with this assignment! :) Also, if you have not taken Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning<br>before then you have just now completed your first exercise in Machine Learning. You just<br>created a program that may predict the ratings of movie reviews based on some learning it did<br>before based on some reviews that already had ratings associated with them. Well, even though<br>our algorithm is very simple, this is the basic idea behind Machine Learning. Newcomers,<br>welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence! :)<br>3. Sample Output<br>If your program runs correctly without any errors, then NO OUTPUT will be written to the<br>console. If any input/output file cannot be opened, only then your program writes some error<br>messages to the console. All error handling is already taken care of in the file ​main.cpp​.<br>3.1. Small Data<br>INPUT FILES:<br>Rated Review File: ​rawReviewRatings.txt<br>Unrated Review File: ​rawReviews.txt<br>Stopwords File: ​stopwords.txt<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>OUTPUT FILES:<br>Cleaned Rated Review File: ​cleanReviewRatings.txt<br>Cleaned Unrated Review File: ​cleanReviews.txt<br>Ratings File: ​ratings.txt<br>3.2. “Big” Data<br>INPUT FILES:<br>Rated Review File: ​rawReviewRatingsBig.txt<br>Unrated Review File: ​rawReviewsBig.txt<br>Stopwords File: ​stopwords.txt<br>OUTPUT FILES:<br>Cleaned Rated Review File: ​cleanReviewRatings.txt<br>Cleaned Unrated Review File: ​cleanReviews.txt<br>Ratings File: ​ratings.txt<br>4. Important Details<br>1. The code for this assignment is split across 5 files.<br>a. main.cpp<br>b. a2.hpp<br>c. a2.cpp​ (This is the ONLY file you should modify!)<br>d. trim.hpp<br>e. trim.cpp<br>The .hpp files are the header files which contain only the declaration of the functions and<br>the .cpp files are the source files which contain the implementation of these functions. If<br>you want to understand more about why we have separate header and source files, then<br>maybe you should read ​this​.<br>2. Take some time to read the source code starting from the main() function that is present<br>inside the file main.cpp.<br>3. All the code you write for this assignment will only be inside the file ​a2.cpp. You should<br>not perform any file IO, print to stdout, or print to stderr in a2.cpp.<br>4. The files trim.hpp and trim.cpp are provided only to help you with trimming the<br>whitespaces in strings since doing so in C++ is not so easy as it’s in Java. You may read<br>these files to find out how to trim strings for this assignment.<br>5. You should use the following command to ​compile​​ your program.<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>$ g++ <em>.cpp -std=c++11<br>where </em>.cpp means all the .cpp files are to be compiled. You need not mention the<br>names of the .hpp files since they are included from within the .cpp files. The option<br>“-std=c++11” informs the compiler that our may contain C++11 features (e.g.<br>std::unordered_map was introduced only in C++11).<br>6. Your program takes the two files ​rawReviewRatings.txt and ​rawReviews.txt as ​command<br>line arguments​. ​​You should run your program as shown below:<br>$ ./a.out rawReviewRatings.txt rawReviews.txt<br>If you don’t give these 2 command line arguments to your program, then the following<br>error message will be printed. This error handling is already handled for you in main.cpp.<br>$ ./a.out<br>USAGE: ./a.out <reviewratingsfile> <reviewsfile><br>7. If your program works correctly without any errors, then nothing is printed to the console.<br>Only the three output files cleanReviewRatings.txt, cleanReviews.txt and ratings.txt will<br>be produced. You may even try compiling and running your program before adding any<br>code in a2.cpp to see if these 3 output files are produced. The contents of these output<br>files will be empty until the methods in a2.cpp are implemented.<br>8. You should NOT add any new functions/methods in a2.cpp.<br>9. You ​SHOULD NOT MODIFY​​ any of the following in a2.cpp:<br>a. Names of the functions<br>b. Names and types of the parameters to a function.<br>c. Return types of the functions.<br>10.An approximate number of lines of code is given for each function in a2.cpp. These are<br>the number of lines for each function in Gerald’s implementation of a2.cpp. We have<br>provided this information since it may help you to see how little code you may write if you<br>make use of the C++ Standard Library effectively. This would help you to stop and think<br>for a while before you may write a lot of code by yourself and maybe later realize that<br>you could have used some functionality from the standard library to do the same thing<br>with little code and more effectively!<br>11.Updates to this specification that may be posted on piazza are also part of this<br>specification.<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>5. Grading Scheme<br>Item  Grade<br>Correctness of your code  90<br>Code Style (indentation) &amp;<br>Implementation Comments in a2.cpp<br>10<br>TOTAL  100<br>6. Submission<br>Submit ​ONLY your a2.cpp​​ file at the following location:<br>/p/course/cs368-gerald/public/handin/<cslogin>/a2<br>Remember that ​no late work is accepted​​ in this course and there are no exceptions!<br>Hope you have a great time learning and coding associative containers and<br>algorithms using the C++ Standard Library! :)<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br><br><br></cslogin></reviewsfile></reviewratingsfile></string,></review></rating></font>

You will be using the sklearn machine learning library to perform this study. The dataset is based on four wilderness areas in the Roosevelt National Forest, located in the Front Range of northern Colorado. Cover type data came from US Forest Service inventory information, while the cartographic variables used to predict cover type consisted of elevation, aspect, and other information derived from standard digital spatial data processed in a geographic information system (GIS).<br>Data Set Information:<br>The prediction of forest cover type is from cartographic variables only (no remotely sensed data). The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Resource Information System (RIS) data. Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data. Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types).<br>This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.<br>Some background information for these four wilderness areas: Neota (area 2)<br>probably has the highest mean elevational value of the 4 wilderness areas. Rawah (area 1) and Comanche Peak (area 3) would have a lower mean elevational value, while Cache la Poudre (area 4) would have the lowest mean elevational value.<br>As for primary major tree species in these areas, Neota would have spruce/fir (type 1), while Rawah and Comanche Peak would probably have lodgepole pine (type 2) as their primary species, followed by spruce/fir and aspen (type 5). Cache la Poudre would tend to have Ponderosa pine (type 3), Douglas-fir (type 6), and cottonwood/willow (type 4).<br>The Rawah and Comanche Peak areas would tend to be more typical of the overall dataset than either the Neota or Cache la Poudre, due to their assortment of tree species and range of predictive variable values (elevation, etc.) Cache la Poudre would probably be more unique than the others, due to its relatively low elevation range and species composition.<br>Attribute Information:<br>Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The forest cover type is the classification problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of entries along the vectors of the database.<br>Name / Data Type / Measurement / Description<br>Elevation / quantitative /meters / Elevation in meters<br>Aspect / quantitative / azimuth / Aspect in degrees azimuth<br>Slope / quantitative / degrees / Slope in degrees<br>Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology / quantitative / meters / Horz Dist to nearest surface water features<br>Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology / quantitative / meters / Vert Dist to nearest surface water features<br>Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways / quantitative / meters / Horz Dist to nearest roadway<br>Hillshade_9am / quantitative / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at 9am, summer solstice<br>Hillshade_Noon / quantitative / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at noon, summer soltice<br>Hillshade_3pm / quantitative / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at 3pm, summer solstice<br>Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points / quantitative / meters / Horz Dist to nearest wildfire ignition points<br>Wilderness_Area (4 binary columns) / qualitative / 0 (absence) or 1 (presence) / Wilderness area designation<br>Soil_Type (40 binary columns) / qualitative / 0 (absence) or 1 (presence) / Soil Type designation<br>Cover_Type (7 types) / integer / 1 to 7 / Forest Cover Type designation<br>Your tasks<br>Preprocessing (5 marks)<br>Write a Python script (with the file named task_1.py), that<br>loads the dataset shuffles the data<br>deals with any missing value (if any)<br>performs normalization of the data<br>creates numpy arrays train_data, validation_data and test_data which contain respectively 70%, 15% and 15% of the shuffled data.<br>saves these preprocessed arrays<br>Whenever applicable use the validation set to select the architectural<br>parameters needed to build the following classifiers;<br>Naive Bayes (5 marks)<br>Write a Python script (with the file named task_2.py), that<br>builds naïve Bayes classifiers<br>evaluates the prediction errors<br>reports these errors with a confusing matrix<br>Decision Trees (5 marks)<br>Write a Python script (with the file named task_3.py), that<br>builds decision tree classifiers<br>evaluates the classifiers<br>Nearest Neighbours (5 marks)<br>Write a Python script (with the file named task_4.py), that<br>builds kNN classifiers<br>evaluates the classifiers<br>Support Vector Machines (5 marks)<br>Write a Python script (with the file named task_5.py), that<br>builds SVM classifiers<br>evaluates the classifiers<br>Deliverables<br>You should submit via Blackboard a zip file containing<br>A report in pdf format limited to 10 pages of text (be concise!)<br>describing the design of your experiments<br>reporting on the performance of your classifiers<br>a statement of completeness (concise description of what you have implemented, what works, what doesn’t).<br>All your Python script files with proper commenting.
