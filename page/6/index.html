        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>这次需要代写的是一个关于Stack的Lab作业，由于是Lab作业，工作量并不大，都是基本的Stack操作。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>sing Versus Extending an ADT<br><br>Note: In this and future labs we make a distinction between using an ADT and extending an ADT. You must be clear on this distinction:<br><br>Using an ADT<br><br>When asked to use an ADT write a program that is implementation independent, i.e. the program uses only ADT methods (such as those for a stack) and works for either the array or linked implementation of a data structure. Do not change any code in the ADT implementation files such as stack_array.py.<br><br>Extending an ADT<br><br>When asked to extend an ADT you are going to add new methods to an ADT, meaning that you are going to add code to one or both of the array or linked implementation of a data structure, such as stack_array.py.<br><br>The Stack ADT (Abstract Data Type)<br><br>A stack is a data structure that follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) rules. Data is added to the top of a stack and removed from the top of a stack. The Stack ADT provides methods for manipulating data in a stack.<br>A reminder of some important points of ADT use are:<br><br>No matter what the underlying implementation of the stack programs should access a stack only through these methods.<br>As a corollary to the first point, the stack can be implemented in any number of ways so long as any given implementation follows the ADT function requirements. The implementation must invisible to the program using the Stack ADT.<br>A stack may store any type of data, although all the data it stores should be of the same type.<br>The following code imports a stack class and the Food class then initializes a stack:<br><br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>from stack_array import Stack<br>from food import Food<br><br>s = Stack()<br> …<br>The line:<br><br>1<br>from stack_array import Stack<br>imports the Stack class from the library file stack_array.py. This library file can be replaced by any other file that implements the Stack ADT methods.<br>The line:<br><br>1<br>from food import Food<br>gives access to the methods in the food.py library file as above.<br>The line:<br><br>1<br>s = Stack()<br>creates a stack named s. The stack is now ready to accept data.<br><br>Project References<br><br>As we work through the term we will be creating a number of different data structures and adding more functionality to the Food library already written. Making sure that each new project has the latest version of a data structure or Food library is difficult to do if we are reduced to copying and pasting our pydev modules into each new project. Fortunately, Eclipse provides a much better mechanism to reference code. Setting up Project References allows you to link one Pydev project to another, and to use the code from one project in another with the import and from … import * statements already shown. Nothing needs to be changed in your source code.<br>To make a reference from one project to another in Eclipse, right click on a project name in the Navigator pane. From the resulting pop-up menu click on Properties and then on Project References in the resulting dialog box.<br>Click on the check box of all projects that you wish to reference from the current project. In this example the project album is already selected, and the project data_structures will be added as a reference. Once this is done all of the classes in both album and data_structures will be available through import statements.<br>A few things to keep in mind when using project references:<br><br>All referenced projects must be open when attempting to run a program.<br>Submit all referenced projects as part of your Eclipse archive (.zip) file when submitting exercises or the markers will not be able to run your programs. You may select multiple projects to include in an Eclipse archive file.<br>Do not use the same Pydev module names in two different referenced projects or Eclipse will not know which one an import statement is supposed to be referring to.<br>Project references go one way only. If the project stacks references the project data_structures, then data_structures should not reference stacks. Circular references are a very bad idea.<br>Upon occasion referenced projects may become ‘out of sync’ with the project that references them. To fix this, right-click on the project and choose Refresh to update Eclipse from the file system.<br>Array-based Stacks<br><br>The file stack_array.py is a text file containing the basic outline of the array-based Stack class. Copy this code into the Pydev module stack_array.py in your login_data_structures project (where login is your Network login). Thus, a student with the Network login barn4520 should name their projects barn4520_Food and barn4520_data_structures.) The Lab Instructor will walk you through this library and discuss its inner workings.<br><br>Tasks<br><br>(If you were unable to complete Lab 1 correctly, you may use these files: food.py, food_utilities.py, and foods.txt as the basis for your lab. These files will not be available until after the labs for the previous week are completed.)<br>For the appropriate tasks you may download and use the Food class definition in food.py from Lab 1.<br>For all of your data structures (stacks, queues, BSTs, etc.), put your code into libraries in your Pydev project login_data_structures.<br><br>For the stack_array library complete the implementations of the is_empty, pop, and peek methods. These methods extend the Stack ADT.<br>Write and test the following function:<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>def array_to_stack(s, a):<br>    “””<br>    ——————————————————-<br>    Pushes contents of a onto s.<br>    Use: array_to_stack(s, a)<br>    ——————————————————-<br>    Preconditions:<br>        s - a Stack object (Stack)<br>        a - a Python list (list)<br>    Postconditions:<br>        The contents of a are moved into s, a is empty.<br>    ——————————————————-<br>    “””<br>Add this function to a Pydev module named utilities in your login_data_structures project so that you have easy access to it later.<br><br>Write and test the following function:<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>def stack_to_array(s, a):<br>    “””<br>    ——————————————————-<br>    Pops contents of s into a.<br>    Use: stack_to_array(s, a)<br>    ——————————————————-<br>    Preconditions:<br>        s - a Stack object (Stack)<br>        a - a Python list (list)<br>    Postconditions:<br>        Contents of s are moved into a, s is empty.<br>    ——————————————————-<br>    “””<br>Add this function to the Pydev module named utilities in your login_data_structures project.<br><br>Write and test the following function:<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>def stack_test(a):<br>    “””<br>    ——————————————————-<br>    Tests<br>    Use: stack_test(a)<br>    ——————————————————-<br>    Preconditions:<br>        a - list of data (list of ?)<br>    Postconditions:<br>        the methods of Stack are tested for both empty and<br>        non-empty stacks using the data in a:<br>        is_empty, push, pop, peek<br>    ——————————————————-<br>    “””<br>    s = Stack()<br><br>    # tests for the stack methods go here<br>    # print the results of the method calls and verify by hand<br><br>    return<br>Add this function to the Pydev module named utilities in your login_data_structures project.<br>Use a list of integers to test your stack code.<br><br>Re-use stack_test, but this time pass it a list of Food data.

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>用Java Swing作为GUI，从文件中读取信息并显示，实现逻辑，整体控件不多，很基础的作业。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>What to turn in<br><br>Use Export Project in NetBeans to export your project to a zip file, name it YourLastName_FirstName_project.zip. Send the file as a single attachment through Blackboard. The subject of this email is YourLastName_FirstName_project.<br><br>Note<br><br>Write your name as a comment line at the very beginning of each .java program: 1 point deducted for each file without your name at top.<br>Besides this documentation, I also provide you a text file, accounts.txt (described below). You should download this text file into the directory of your Netbeans project for your programs. Make sure when accessing this text file programmatically, your program just uses the file name without explicitly providing a path (so called relative path). For instance,<br>1<br>File accountFile = new File(“accounts.txt”);<br>For more information about the absolute path, refer to chapter 18 lecture slides. Failing to use the relative path loses 4 points.<br><br>Suggestions<br><br>Start early and start from simple – this is VERY important. For example, begin from the week when the project is available. As the first step, you construct the GUI but not implement functions for button clicks.<br>For the give function buttons, you may start to implement the Exit function first, and then the functions of Deposit and Withdraw buttons.<br>Always keep a copy of your working code before you implement more requirements.<br>Requirements in summary<br><br>1) Develop a Java GUI application that reads account information from the provided text file (accounts.txt), shows all account numbers in a JComboBox, and displays other GUI controls as shown in Fig. 1;<br>2) Exit button : Quit the application;<br>3) Deposit button: Make a deposit to a selected account;<br>4) Withdraw button: Make a withdrawal from a selected account;<br>5) Transfer To button: Make a transfer from a selected account to a beneficiary account;<br><br>Requirements in details<br><br>GUI in general<br><br>Once the program starts, it reads all account information from accounts.txt (each row in the file is a account record and is in the format of<br><br>accountNumber&lt;&gt;openDate&lt;&gt;customerName&lt;&gt;balance<br>The openDate is in the format of year/month/day.) It then fills a JComboBox with all account numbers and shows other GUI controls as in Fig. 1. Your program must be able to “read” the file of this format programmatically because when I test your project, the file content (not the format) will be changed.<br>When you select an item (account number) from the JComboBox, the corresponding values for openDate, customerName, and balance will be shown in the three read-only text fields, and the Deposit, Withdraw, and Transfer To buttons become enabled, see Fig. 2.<br><br>Exit<br><br>Clicking this button to close the frame and exit the program.<br>Instead of using mouse to click the button, pressing Alt + x will also trigger the Exit button.<br>Deposit<br><br>(After selecting an account number from the JComboBox), clicking the Deposit button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 3 asking you to enter a deposit amount for the selected account. Hint: this dialog window is generated by JOptionPane.showInputDialog().<br>If you enter a non-negative number, such as 100, the amount will be deposited to the account. See Fig 4 - the balanced is adjusted accordingly. The accounts.txt file should also be updated accordingly as well.<br>If you clicking Cancel in Fig. 3, nothing will happen to this account.<br>If an invalid deposit amount is entered in Fig. 3, such as -100 or $100, you will see an error message as shown in Fig 5.<br>Hint: this dialog window is generated by JOptionPane. showConfirmDialog().<br><br>Withdraw<br><br>(After selecting an account from the JComboBox), clicking the Withdraw button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 6 asking you to enter a withdrawal amount for the selected account.<br>If you enter a non-negative number, such as 100, and if the account balance is sufficient, the withdrawal will be made from the account successfully. See Fig. 7, the balanced is adjusted. The accounts.txt file should also be updated accordingly as well.<br>If you clicking Cancel in Fig. 6, nothing will occur to this account.<br>If an invalid withdrawal amount is entered in Fig. 6, such as -100 or $100, you will see an error message as shown in Fig 8.<br>If a withdrawal amount is greater than the balance, you show an error message and stop the withdrawal.<br>Transfer To<br><br>(After selecting an account from the JComboBox), clicking the Transfer To button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 10 asking you to enter a beneficiary account number.<br>If a valid account number (any number existing in the JComboBox) is entered, after click OK button, a window like Fig. 11 pops up asking for amount to transfer.<br>If a valid amount is entered, and the balance is not less than this amount and sometimes the sum of this transfer amount and a transfer fee, the transfer will be succeeded as shown in Fig. 12 and 13. The transfer fee is only applied to account with the balance less than $10000 which is specified in AccountConstants interface (more about AccountConstants see end of this document).<br>If an invalid beneficiary account number (i.e., a number which does not exist in the account number JComboBox) is entered in Fig. 10, Fig. 14 shows the error message.<br>If the balance is not sufficient for the transfer amount, Fig. 15 shows the error message.<br>If the balance is not sufficient to cover both transfer amount and transfer fee (when such a fee applies), Fig. 16 shows the error message.<br>Design requirements<br><br>You must have the following five classes (at least 5 points deduction for missing a required class).<br><br>AccountConstants – contains two constants, CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD (value is 10000) and TRANSFER_FEE (value is 2.0). For this project, the business rule is as follows:<br>When making a transfer to a beneficiary account, if the balance of the transferring account is less than CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD, TRANSFER_FEE is deducted from the balance after the transfer is made. If the balance is not sufficient to cover both CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD and TRANSFER_FEE (if the fee applies), the transfer should not be made. If the balance of transferring account is not less than CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD, TRANSFER_FEE is waived for this transfer.<br>Account – transferTo() method is abstract. deposit() and withdraw() are not abstract. If you need, feel free to define other methods, such as getBalance(), in the Account class.<br>CheckingAccount: extends Account and implements the transferTo method (refer to the above diagram). The returned value of transferTo method is defined as follows.<br>return 0: transfer successful and without transfer fee<br>return 1: transfer successful and with the transfer fee applied<br>return -1: transfer unsuccessful because balance is less than transfer amount and transfer fee<br>return -2: transfer unsuccessful because balance is less than transfer amount<br>AccountUtility – reads accounts.txt file, updates the file, and provides data for other programs.<br>AccountApp – is the only Java program having the main method. This must be the only file with a main method. If not, you lose 5 points.<br>Depending on your design and it’s your decision that you may have more Java programs than those specified above.<br></font>

A description of your program will need to be included in the assignment header. This particular header can be added to your file by entering hhw while in command mode in vi.<br>Each example execution represents a single test of your program. The six examples provided imply that the program was run six different times.<br>Your program is expected to accept input and produce output in the same manner demonstrated above.<br>The user will always enter a positive integer followed by a single digit in the range from 1 to 9.<br>Each test case will result in finding a multiple that is less than or equal to INT_MAX as found in the limits.h library.<br>Do not add any “bonus” features not demonstrated in the example executions provided.<br>Course standards prohibit the use of programming concepts not yet introduced in lecture. For this assignment you can consider all material in the first six chapters of the book, notes, and lectures to be acceptable for use.<br>The use of arrays will result in no credit being awarded for your effort.<br>For this assignment you will be required to implement the user-defined functions (from chapter 4). Failing to follow course standards as they relate to good user-defined function use will result in a zero for this assignment.<br>A program MUST compile to be considered for partial credit. The submission script will reject the submission of any file that does not successfully compile on the guru server. The name of the source code file you attempt to submit must be hw05.c, no variation is permitted.<br>Course Programming and Documentation Standards Reminders<br><br>Use the course function header (head_fx vi shortcut hfx while in command mode) for every user-defined function in your program.<br>List and comment all parameters to a function, one per line, in the course function header.<br>All function declarations will appear in the global declaration section of your program.<br>The user-defined function definitions will appear in your program after the main function.<br>Indent all code within relevant selection and repetition constructs two additional spaces.<br>Make use of { and } with all relevant selection and repetition constructs.<br>Place a single space between all operators and operands. Comment all variables to the right of each declaration. Declare only one variable per line.<br>Notice that several programs (see program 2-9 on pages 74-75) in the programming text use a single line comment to indicate the start of the local declaration and executable statement sections of the main function.<br>At no point during the semester should these two sections ever overlap. You might consider adopting this habit of commenting the start of each section to help you avoid this mistake.<br>Select meaningful identifiers (names) for all variables and functions in your program.<br>Indent all code found within the main and all user-defined functions exactly two spaces.<br>Control-forcing statements such as exit, break, continue, and the use of multiple return statements in a single function are not acceptable practices according to course standards.<br>Do not single (or double) space the entire program, use blank lines when appropriate.<br>Consider making symbolic/defined constants to represent those values that do not change during the execution of the program.<br>There is no need to include example output with your submission.<br>Remove any diagnostic print statements from your code, even if they are commented out (inactive), unless you believe your program to be logically incorrect or incomplete as a way to demonstrate to your lab instructor how much of the problem you were able to solve and attempted to implement.<br></font>

This time period is colloquially known as funball season. The goal of funball is to score the most points. Many cities have their own funball teams and compete in the NFL. Despite the name, funball is very serious and the games are extremely competitive.<br>In June after the regular season, the NFL hosts a single-elimination tournament to determine the best funball team. Win or go home! The winner gets a year’s worth of bragging rights and claim to a rotating trophy.<br>In an attempt to make the tournament as exciting as possible, the NFL pairs stronger teams with weaker teams in the early rounds expecting that only the best teams will be left at the end of the tournament. The process of ranking teams is called seeding. Lower seed values indicate stronger teams.<br>For logistical reasons, the tournament is broken into 4 regions: N, S, E, and W.<br>The tournament is so popular that several derived games have appeared. Among the most popular is a pick’em challenge where players attempt to pick all of the winners in the tournament before any tournament games are played. In recent years, the pick’em challenge has been hosted by Sanguine Bank which offered a million dollar prize to anyone who could pick all of the correct teams.<br><br>Questions<br><br>Let p(A) be the winning percentage of team A and p B be the winning percentage of team B. Assume we use the formula 1 to estimate the probability that A wins in a matchup against B.<br><br>P(A wins|A and B play) = p(A)(1 - p(B)) / p(A)(1 - p(B)) + (1 - p(A))p(B)<br>Using this formula, which year’s tournament results had the highest probability?<br>To answer this question, please use the attached data.<br><br>regular season results.csv<br>seasons.csv<br>teams.csv<br>tourney results.csv<br>tourney seeds.csv<br>tourney slots.csv<br>Sanguine Bank has decided that the payout of the pick’em challenge is too risky. They contacted Auspicious Insurance Group (AIG) for a quote on a special insurance contract that covers the payout from the challenge. How much should AIG charge Sanguine Bank for the insurance<br>contract? It is sufficient to explain your approach; no code or amounts are required for this question.<br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>代写一个比较炫酷的3D的游戏，本质上其实还是在2D上的Grid运算，只不过GUI方面提供了3D的渲染引擎。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>For your first assignment you’ll be implementing a simple colour matching game inspired by the Bejeweled series and creatively titled “Colour Match”. The game revolves around finding groups of the same colour on a 3D grid of cubes. The basic gameplay is as follows:<br><br>When the game starts a grid of random colours will appear on screen.<br>In a separate section of the screen, the player will be shown a random colour – this is known as the “Next Colour”.<br>Using the arrow keys, the player will select one of the cubes on the grid and when they press the spacebar key, the colour of the selected cube will change to match the “Next Colour”.<br>If the change in colour causes three or more cubes of the same colour to be “connected”, those cubes are removed from the screen and the player’s score is increased (the amount of score increase is up to you, but they should get bigger scores for matching larger amounts of cubes).<br>After the matched cubes are removed, cubes above them on the grid should move down to fill their place (there should never be any holes in the board). New cubes should also appear along the top of the board to fill the place of any cubes which fell down to a lower row.<br>After the cubes are removed, the “Next Colour” is randomised again and the player can pick another cube to replace.<br>When the game ends, a game over screen should be displayed which tells the player their final score. A quit and a restart button should also be present on this screen.<br>The end condition of the game is controlled by two things:<br><br>If a move doesn’t result in a match of three or more connected cubes, a life is lost. After losing three lives, the game ends.<br>A move counter should also be included which limits the amount of allowed moves per game. The player should be able to see the amount of moves remaining somewhere in the UI.<br>To spice up the gameplay, a special Power Cube should be included, as outlined below:<br><br>When the player selects a cube on the grid and activates the power cube with the P key, every cube on the grid that matches the selected colour should be removed from the board.<br>The score rewarded should be based on the amount of cubes that were removed.<br>The power cube is available from the start of the game and can only be used once - use it wisely!<br>Defining “Connected”<br><br>There are a few options for what we consider “connected” to mean. You can attempt one of the three options presented below depending on the grade you’re targeting.<br><br>To receive a pass for the criterion “Are matching cubes correctly identified?”, you should look for matching colours in the immediate four neighbors. In the below images, the dark grey tile is the selected cell for the current turn, and the light grey are matching colours which should be removed.<br>To receive a medium grade, you should look for lines of the same colour originating from the selected cell on any of its four sides.<br>To be eligible for full marks, you should keep stepping through neighbours and find chunks of the same colour.<br>Provided Assets<br><br>Provided inside the Assignment 1 Assets file on Moodle are all the assets you’ll need to create the game. The cubes have a width and length of one unit allowing for easier placement. It is recommended you build your solution off the Week 3 Base Code (while waiting for that code to be released, you should spend week two thinking about your solution).<br>Please note that while additional assets may be included, they won’t be considered when marking.<br>Only your C++ code and the quality of your gameplay will be assessed (we’re not marking your modelling skills).<br><br><br><br></font>

Your responsibility is to insert the HTML tags with the<br>appropriate JavaScript statements that will solve the problem discussed below, and to<br>comment the html file with the requested information per the requirements. The problem<br>description and HTML program provided are slightly different from Assignment 6. Be sure to<br>start fresh.<br>2<br>Problem to solve:<br>The Serendipity Booksellers has a book club that awards points to its customers based on the<br>number of books purchased each month. The points are awarded as follows:<br> If a customer purchases 0 books, they earn 0 points<br> If a customer purchases 1 book, they earn 4 points<br> If a customer purchases 2 books, they earn 8 points<br> If a customer purchases 3 books, they earn 16 points<br> If a customer purchases more than 3 books, they earn an additional 7 points on top of<br>the 16 points for each book above 3.<br>Serendipity Booksellers also awards points based on the dollar value spent on non-book<br>merchandise. Four (4) points are awarded for every $10 spent. Partial awards are not provided.<br>For example, 4 points will be awarded for spending $10.00 up to $10.99. No points are awarded<br>for less than $10.<br>Preferred Customers receive a bonus of double award points.<br>The Serendipity Booksellers website needs to be updated to ask the customer to enter the<br>number of books purchased last month, the dollars spent on non-book merchandise, confirm if<br>they are a Preferred Customer, and then calculate and display the number of award points<br>earned.<br>Requirements:<br>For this assignment;<br>1. Your program will calculate the award points as described above.<br>2. You will generate HTML comments to add your name, section and TA name. Each on a<br>separate line within the <head> tags. This will (should) NOT be visible in the document<br>on the web browser).<br>3. Utilize a <form> tag<br>4. You will then add the HTML tags with the proper JavaScript code to produce:<br>a. A textbox to solicit the number of books purchased<br>b. A textbox to solicit the dollars of non-book merchandise<br>c. Grouped radio buttons to determine Preferred Customer membership<br>d. A button to calculate the number of points awarded<br>e. A readonly textbox to display the result the calculation<br>5. Utilize JavaScript comments to explain the steps you are preforming within your code. A<br>JavaScript comment’s form is:<br>/<em> Place your comment between the stars </em>/<br>3<br>6. Variable names should be descriptive. For example, if a program is calculating the total<br>charge for a bill at a restaurant, it may have a variable named tipAmount.<br>7. Utilize at least one if/else statement. Consider using the if/else in determining the<br>bonus points.<br>A sample of what your webpage could look like:<br>Additional Information:<br>Since the contents of a textbox, is going to be used in mathematical operations. Textboxes<br>sometimes treat input as Strings. Use the function parseInt() to convert the String text to a<br>number.

The games have been<br>scheduled to begin on Saturday 3rd December 2016, competitors are busy training and now it’s time<br>to prepare to sell spectator tickets.<br>Your task is to design, develop and test a small application for recording ticket sales to this event.<br>Stage 1: Design<br>This stage requires you to prepare documentation that describes the function of the program and how<br>it is to be tested. There is no coding or code testing involved in this stage. A document template has<br>been provided for your use.<br>Requirements:<br>1) Read through Stage 2: Program Development to obtain details of the requirements of this<br>program.<br>2) Write an algorithm that describes how the program will operate.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced – must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. The algorithm must be structured logically so that the program would function correctly.<br>3) Prepare and document test cases that can be used to check that the program works correctly,<br>once it has been coded. You do NOT need to actually run the test cases in this stage; this will<br>occur in Stage 3: Testing.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced, must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. Make sure the test cases include checking of data entered by the user to make sure that<br>only valid data is accepted. If the user enters invalid data, the user should be informed of<br>this and given another chance to enter the data. NB: As we have not covered exception<br>handling, you may assume that the user will always enter an integer.<br>c. Test cases should be documented using a template like the one below. You may include<br>extra information if you wish. At this stage, the Actual Result column will be left blank.<br>Test Case  Expected Result  Actual Result<br>The user selects to purchase Tier 1<br>tickets.<br>The user is prompted to<br>enter the number of<br>tickets to purchase.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 3 of 9<br>Stage 2: Program Development<br>Using the Design Documentation to assist you, develop a Java program that records spectator ticket<br>sales at the gate for the Federation University Australia Olympic Games, implementing the<br>requirements outlined in this section. These requirements have been broken into three groups:<br>  Base Functionality includes the minimal level of requirements to achieve the essential<br>components of this assignment. This group of requirements focuses on getting the code to<br>work and on using the programming constructs we cover in class. You can expect to use<br>constants, variables, loops, conditional statements and arithmetic operators for these<br>requirements and you should look for opportunities to use these wherever you can. You will not<br>receive full marks for implementing a requirement, even if it works, if you have not used the<br>appropriate programming construct to do so.<br>At this level, you can decide if it is easier for you to code everything within a single method, or<br>to modularize it straight away.<br>  Standard Functionality ensures the code is modularized, and that method calls are used to<br>ensure the program flows correctly. It allows data to pass from one method to another as<br>parameters. It also includes providing a running total of tickets within an order, which is not<br>essential for getting the program to work, but is useful information for the user to see.<br>  Advanced Functionality provides a challenge task, and is best left until all the other requirements<br>have been addressed. It requires looking at a Java API to find out how to use a class we have<br>not covered in the course, and using this to provide a countdown of days remaining until the<br>games commence.<br>All three groups require that you follow coding conventions, such as proper layout of code, using<br>naming conventions and writing meaningful comments throughout your program.<br>Base Functionality:<br>1. Display a welcome message when the program starts<br>  The welcome message should have a row of asterisks at the top and the bottom, just long<br>enough to extend over the text. Hint: Use a For loop for this.<br>  The first line of the message should read “FEDERATION UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIA<br>OLYMPICS” and be approximately centred in the row of asterisks by printing white space<br>first. Hint: Can you modify the For loop from the previous step to print the white spaces?<br>  A second line of the message should be blank.<br>  The third line should read “Developed by” followed by your name and a comma, then “<br>student ID ”, then your student id, then finally “ for ITECH1000 Sem 2 2016”.<br>  The fourth line should be blank.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 4 of 9<br>2. Provide a menu from which the user can select to Purchase Tickets, View Ticket Sales or Exit.<br>This menu should be repeated each time after the user has chosen and completed an option until<br>the user chooses to Exit. The user selects an option by entering the number next to it. If an<br>invalid number is selected, the user is advised and shown the menu again to make another<br>selection.<br>3. When the user selects the Purchase Tickets option, provide another menu from which the user<br>can select Tier 1 Tickets, Tier 2 Tickets, Finalise Order or Cancel Order. The user selects an<br>option by entering the number next to it. If an invalid number is selected, the user is advised and<br>shown the menu again to make another selection.<br>a. Should the user select Tier 1 Tickets or Tier 2 Tickets, they are prompted to enter the<br>Number of Tickets required. After entering the number of tickets required, they are<br>returned to the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that they may choose to purchase additional<br>tickets. The user may not choose to purchase a negative number of tickets, but a<br>purchase of 0 tickets is permitted.<br>b. Should the user select Finalise Order:<br>i. The sale is processed by displaying the number of each type of ticket purchased<br>and the total cost of the tickets in this order. A Tier 1 ticket costs $18.50; a Tier 2<br>ticket costs $11.25.<br>ii. A record is kept of the total cost of tickets sold, the total number of Tier 1 tickets<br>sold and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold. This is a combined total from all<br>orders; there is no need to keep a record of the number of tickets in each<br>individual order.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 5 of 9<br>iii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>c. Should the user select Cancel Order:<br>i. The order is cancelled and a message displayed to confirm this to the user.<br>ii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>4. When the user selects the View Ticket Sales option, display the total value of ticket sales and both<br>the total number of Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold across ALL orders.<br>Highlight this message display with a row of 50 asterisks before and after the message. After the<br>final row of asterisks, redisplay the menu from Step 2.<br>5. When the user selects Exit System, quit the program with a message to the user.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 6 of 9<br>Standard Functionality:<br>6. Update the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that a running total of tickets included in an order is<br>displayed until the order is finalized<br>7. Modularize the code, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods as<br>parameters.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>8. Update the Welcome Message to include a countdown of the number of days to go until the<br>games begin.<br>a. Use the GregorianCalendar class to manage your dates. You will need to import<br>java.util.GregorianCalendar to use this library.<br>b. The countdown must be calculated based on the number of days between the time the<br>program runs, and Saturday 3rd December 2016. It should also be possible to just update<br>the date within the code and have the countdown automatically recalculate the number of<br>days until the games commence.<br>c. There is no pre-defined method for finding the difference between two dates in this library.<br>You will need to develop your own, using the features of the GregorianCalendar class.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 7 of 9<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Using a copy of the test cases developed in Stage 1: Design, test the program you have developed in<br>Stage 2: Program Development. Document your results, including both failed and successful tests.<br>Note: Please do not leave out any failed tests. If your testing highlights that your program has not<br>worked correctly, then the failed tests help to demonstrate that you have been testing your program<br>properly.<br>To show that you have tested your program, include small (but readable) screen captures in your<br>Actual Results as well as any explanatory comments. Microsoft Windows includes a Snipping Tool<br>that is useful for taking captures of the relevant parts of the screen.<br>You may test your program in phases if you wish. Stage 2: Program Development provides three<br>separate groups of functionality in the requirements, working from the minimal level of requirements<br>through to more advanced concepts. Each of these groups can be tested individually.<br>Base Functionality:<br>This phase requires you to check that the base functions (displaying welcome message when the<br>program starts, showing a menu of options until the user chooses to exit, purchasing tickets, viewing<br>ticket sales and exiting the system) have been implemented.<br>Standard Functionality:<br>In addition to the Base Functionality, this section includes displaying a running total of tickets that have<br>been added to an order until such time as the order has been finalized. This new functionality must<br>also be tested.<br>If you originally wrote and tested the Base Functionality by including all the code in a single method,<br>this phase also requires that you modularize your code, and use method calls and pass data between<br>methods to ensure your program still runs correctly. This means all your code will need to be re-<br>tested to ensure that all the previous functionality still works.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>This phase requires testing the code that calculates and displays the number of days until the games<br>comments in the welcoming message shown when the program starts.<br>Submission<br>Your program code and testing documentation should be zipped into a single file and loaded into the<br>Assignment Box provided in Moodle by the due date and time.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 8 of 9<br>Marking Criteria/Rubric<br>Task<br>Available<br>Marks<br>Student<br>Mark<br>Stage 1: Design Documentation<br>Development of an algorithm describing how the program should function<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Logical structure  1<br>Documented test cases to validate program<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Data is validated to ensure user entries are appropriate and incorrect user entries<br>are handled smoothly<br>1<br>Stage 2: Program Development<br>A Java program addressing the requirements outlined in the Assignment Details section,<br>including appropriate use of loops, conditional statements, constants and variables:<br>Use of coding conventions throughout entire program, including readable and clear layout,<br>following naming conventions and including meaningful and appropriate comments.<br>1<br>Base Functionality:<br>  Display of a welcome message when the program starts  1<br>  Menu displayed until user chooses to exit  1<br>  Purchase Tickets option to select and order a user-selected combination of Tier 1<br>and Tier 2 tickets<br>2<br>  View Ticket Sales to display the total value of ticket sales and both the total number<br>of Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold<br>1<br>  Exit System to quit the program with a message to the user  1<br>Standard Functionality:<br>  Running total of tickets included in an order displayed in the Purchase Tickets menu<br>until the order is finalised<br>1<br>  Code modularized, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods  2<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>  Countdown of days to go until the games commence included in the welcome<br>message<br>3<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Documented test results clearly showing all the testing that has been conducted and the<br>results of this testing.<br>  Testing of base functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of standard functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of advanced functionality<br>1<br>Total  20<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 9 of 9<br>Feedback<br>Assignments will be marked within 2 weeks of submission.
