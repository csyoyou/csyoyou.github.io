A demo of<br>the application and several files to help you<br>get started are available for download on the<br>course web site.<br>The project’s learning objective is to use inheritance to quickly create a pair of new object classes<br>that take advantage of work performed in previous labs and projects. The UML below shows<br>how these classes relate together.<br>+getX(): int<br>+getY(): int<br>+getLocation(): Point<br>+moveTo(absX: int, absY: int): void<br>+moveTo(whereToGo: Point): void<br>+moveBy (dX: int, dY: int): void<br>+move (): void<br>+getVelocityX(): double<br>+getVelocityY(): double<br>+setVelocity(dvX: double, dvY: double): void<br>+getColor(): Color<br>+setColor(theColor: Color): void<br>+draw(pen: Graphics): void<br>«interface»<br>DrawableInterface<br>+tossBook(): void<br>-Location: Point<br>-xVelocity: double<br>-yVelocity: double<br>-shirtColor: Color<br>-myBook: DrawableTextbook<br>DrawableStudent<br>-getBookInitials: String<br>-checkBounds(pen: Graphics): void<br>-Location: Point<br>-xVelocity: double<br>-yVelocity: double<br>-bookColor: Color<br>DrawableTextbook<br>+getName: String<br>+getBook: Textbook<br>+getHealth: double<br>+getKnowledge: int<br>+setName(theName: String): void<br>+learnSomething(numPages: int): int<br>-name: String<br>-book: Textbook<br>-health: double<br>-knowledge: int<br>Student<br>+getSubject: String<br>+getPageCount: int<br>+getUnreadPageCount: int<br>+getWeight: double<br>+readPages(numPages: int): int<br>-subject: String<br>-pageCount: int<br>-unreadPageCount: int<br>Textbook<br>REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH CLASS CAN BE FOUND BELOW:<br>The Textbook Class<br>You should re-use your Textbook class from Project 1.

To help resolve any issues or errors you<br>may have had in implementing the class, a model solution has been posted on the course web<br>site in the Project02 Starter Package.<br>The Interface DrawableInterface<br>In Lab 06 you designed the Java interface DrawableInterface and implemented it in the<br>Ball and Block classes. In this project, you will re-use that interface. The requirements for the<br>interface DrawableInterface can be found in the UML diagram above. This interface and its<br>methods should be fully documented using javadoc style comments.<br>The DrawableStudent Class<br>The DrawableStudent class represents the visualization of a university student. It should<br>have all the characteristics and behaviors of a Student, but also implement the<br>DrawableInterface. You should implement all methods described in the interface,<br>similar to the steps you took in Lab 06, except, instead of using a data field for the x-<br>position and a data field for the y-position, use a single Point object.<br>Because we need to draw our textbook, the Textbook data field of our parent will not be<br>enough. We need to create our own DrawableTextbook data field, myBook. Yet, we still<br>want to take advantage of the parent class implementation, so at the end of the constructor,<br>call setBook(myBook) to replace the default parent class Textbook with your<br>DrawableTextbook.<br>The DrawableStudent class needs a tossBook method that sets the velocity of the<br>DrawableTextbook. You only need to set the x-velocity so the textbook moves to the right.<br>If all the classes are implemented properly, the textbook will sense when it gets to the right<br>side of the window and revers direction back to the student.<br>The DrawableTextbook Class<br>The DrawableTextbook class represents the visualization of a university-level textbook. It<br>should have all the characteristics and behaviors of a Textbook, but also implement the<br>DrawableInterface. You should implement all methods described in the interface, similar to<br>the steps you took in Lab 06, except, instead of using a data field for the x-position and a data<br>field for the y-position, use a single Point object.<br>You can use the following Java code to implement the DrawableTextbook class draw method:<br>public void draw(Graphics pen)<br>{<br>checkBounds(pen);<br>pen.setColor(bookColor);<br>pen.fillRect(xPosition, yPosition, 50, 70);<br>pen.setColor(Color.DARK_GRAY);<br>pen.setFont(new Font(“Monospaced”, Font.BOLD, 20));<br>pen.drawString(getBookInitials(), xPosition, yPosition+50);<br>}<br>This method calls two private DrawableTextbook methods, getBookInitials and<br>checkBounds that you must implement.<br>The checkBounds method should perform similar to the checkPosition method in the two<br>previous labs. If the book has moved to the edge of the window, the velocity in that direction<br>should be reversed and the book moved back into the window if it moved off.<br>Since this method is a DrawableTextbook method, we don’t have access to the Panel<br>dimensions. You can use the following code to get the clipping rectangle for the Panel by asking<br>the Graphics object pen:<br>Rectangle edgeRect = pen.getClipBounds();<br>The method getBookInitials creates and returns a string made up of the first letter of each<br>word in the textbook subject. Here are pseudo-code statements that perform the task:<br>String bookSubject = some string to parse<br>String initials = bookSubject.substring(0,1);<br>for (int i = 0; i<booksubject.length()-1; i++)="" {="" if="" (booksubject.charat(i)="='" ')="" initials="" +="bookSubject.substring(i+1," i+2);="" }="" can="" you="" improve="" on="" this="" pseudo-code="" algorithm?="" the="" project2panel="" class="" sets-up="" and="" runs="" simulation.="" should:="" declare="" at="" least="" two="" drawablestudent="" data="" fields="" initialize="" all="" in="" constructor="" paintcomponent="" method="" call="" super.paintcomponent(pen)="" to="" ensure="" screen="" is="" cleared="" windows="" draw="" objects="" implement="" a="" playcatch="" that:="" has="" leftmost="" student="" toss="" textbook="" rightmost="" should="" then="" loop for="" twenty="" seconds="" while="" calling="" repaint="" csc211project2="" instantiate="" object="" method.="" use="" csc211prog02.java="" file="" project02="" starter="" package="" web="" site.="" <="" font=""></booksubject.length()-1;></font>

A boolean circuit is a logical formula<br>consisting of boolean variables a,b,x,y,···, negation (NOT, written as !), con-<br>junction (AND, written as ∧) and disjunction (OR, written as ∨). For example,<br>(a ∧ b) ∨ (c ∨ !(b)) is a boolean circuit on variables a,b and c. The truth value<br>of a boolean circuit is either true or false, and it can be determined when-<br>ever the truth values of all variables of the circuit are fixed. For example, if<br>a = true,b = false and c = true, the truth value of the boolean circuit above<br>is true. An assignment of truth values to the boolean variables of a circuit is<br>called a truth assignment for that circuit.<br>Two circuits are equivalent iff they have the same truth value for all possible<br>truth assignments of their variables. For example, the circuit a ∧ a is equivalent<br>to the circuit a, and the circuit !(a∨b) is equivalent to the circuit !(a)∧!(b). The<br>circuit a∧b is not equivalent to the circuit a∨b, since, for instance, if a = false<br>and b = true, the truth value of the first circuit is false, and the truth value of<br>the second circuit is true.<br>The free variables of a circuit are the variables used in that circuit (without<br>repetitions). For example, the free variables of the circuit (x ∧ y) ∨ !(x) are x<br>and y.<br>The task<br>In this assignment, you are given two classes, Assignment.java and Circuit.java,<br>and they are already implemented for you. In particular, the method equals(),<br>implemented in Circuit.java, allows to determine whether or not two circuits are<br>equivalent.<br>1<br>DIT948-2016, Assignment 3<br>The goal of this assignment is to complete the implementation of subclasses<br>Variable.java, Not.java, And.java e Or.java of the superclass Circuit.java. Con-<br>cretely, you have to complete the implementation of the methods isTrueIn(),<br>freeVariables() and toString() for each subclass (and a few other methods,<br>constructors and instance variables). The methods have the following specifica-<br>tion:<br>• isTrueIn(Assignment a) determines whether a circuit is true for a given<br>assignment a.<br>• freeVariables() returns an array containing the free variables of a cir-<br>cuit, in any order and without repetitions.<br>• toString() returns a string representation of the circuit.<br>You also have to implement a main class, CircuitMain.java, that creates two<br>circuits !(a ∧ b) and !(a) ∨ !(b) and checks whether or not they are equivalent.<br>Finally, you have to create n random circuits of maximal depth 5, calculate their<br>truth value, and print to the console both the (string representation of) circuits<br>and their truth values, for a given positive integer n provided as input by the<br>user.<br>In order to get a VG, you must implement a graphical user interface (GUI) that<br>handles the features in class CircuitMain.java.<br>The specification of each method is provided as commented java files, included<br>in the following sections and available for download from<br><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.cse.chalmers.se/</a> musard/teaching/programming2016/dit948-2016/Assign3 2016.zip<br>The interface, example session<br>The set of all variables used in a random circuit is ”v”,”w”,”x”,”y”,”z”,”a”,”b”,<br>of which the variables ”v”,”y”,”a” are true in the assignment (and, conse-<br>quently, the remaining variables are false). The class CircuitMain has a main<br>method which, when executed, should lead to an user session of the following<br>kind:<br>Welcome to the DIT948 circuit oracle<br>I will now check equivalence for the following circuits:<br>Circuit 1: !((a /\ b))<br>Circuit 2: (!(a) \/ !(c))<br>2<br>DIT948-2016, Assignment 3<br>The result is: false<br>How many random circuits should I generate? 5<br>I have created the following random circuits:<br>1.

Your Java files should<br>be put in a zip-archive with the following name:<br>assign3_author1_author2.zip<br>where author1, author2 are the surnames (family names) of the group members.<br>You must also supply a README-file (README.txt) containing the names of<br>the authors and their social security numbers, together with a brief statement<br>about each author’s contribution. For example, “author1 has been responsible for<br>user input and author2 for the program logic”. A statement such as “All authors<br>have contributed equally to all aspects of the program” is not acceptable.<br>Note that each author must submit individually via the GUL (even though<br>it is the same program!). Only students who submit via the GUL can be graded.<br>All comments etc. will be posted on the course web page.<br>9<br>DIT948-2016, Assignment 3<br>Once the deadline has passed, each group must explain solutions to the TAs<br>during the first Thursday supervision session. Exceptions are to be agreed<br>with the instructor and the TAs.

How can you do your assignment when half of it is gibberish!? You didn’t ask for a task<br>descryption! As you are thinking this, something suddenly occurs to you. You are a Java programmer now!<br>You have all the skills you need to crack this silly cipher, and you’re going to do it!<br>Before You Begin<br>Remember that this task is here to help you improve your programming skills. When doing this task, you<br>might find some parts tricky, but this is normal and also a good thing (if we were never challenged, we would<br>never learn anything!). The most important things are to start this task as soon as you can, to ask questions<br>when you need help and to be persistent! It’s often good to work on one part of the assignment at a time, then<br>submit to PASTA to see how you went with it. Try to be creative when approaching problems - usually there<br>are many ways to do something. We hope you enjoy this cryptography-themed task! :)<br>Part 1 – Your Own Secret Messages<br>In the first part of this assignment, your task is to write a program to encrypt and decrypt your very own secret<br>messages using a substitution cipher! This substitution cipher will involve swapping each letter of the alphabet<br>with a different letter and sometimes also removing spaces. For example, maybe “a” might be replaced with<br>“e”, “b” might be replaced with “a”, “c” might be replaced with “f” and so on.<br>In order to encrypt and decrypt these kinds of messages, the sender and receiver must both know a secret key.<br>A key is a set of rules that tell you which letters to swap with which. One way that you can represent this key<br>is with a string that contains all of the letters from a to z exactly once. The first letter in the string should be<br>the letter that replaces “a” when encrypting, the second letter in the string should be the letter that replaces<br>“b”, the third letter should be the one that replaces “c” etc.<br>For example, if the string is “bzcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxya”, then “a” would be replaced with “b”, “b” would<br>be replaced with “z”, “z” would be replaced with “a” and everything else would stay the same. So, a word like<br>“zebra” would become “aezrb”.<br>When decrypting, the reverse would be done: “b” would be replaced with “a”, “z” would be replaced with<br>“b”, “a” would be replaced with “z” and everything else would stay the same. So, “aezrb” would become<br>“zebra”.<br>All right, with that in mind, are you ready to make your own secret messages?<br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>3<br>Step 1 ‐ Getting the skeleton code<br>In this task description, there is a section called Setting Up. Please read this section carefully for information<br>about the skeleton code and follow the instructions to set up your workspace.<br>Step 2 – Understanding the Encrypter class<br>For this part of the assignment (i.e. Part 1), we will be focusing on only two of the three skeleton code classes:<br>Encrypter and SecretMessages. You could think of the Encrypter class as a set of instructions for<br>making encrypters. That is, things that can encrypt and decrypt secret messages. Each encrypter has its own<br>special key for encrypting and decrypting messages, and also a setting for removing whitespace. (Recall that<br>in programming, all characters that are not visible when displayed are called collectively whitespace. Thus,<br>the whitespace includes the normal space “ ” but also the tab “\t”, new line “\n” and some other characters.)<br>This option to remove whitespace is useful, because messages without<br>spaces are harder to guess. For example, it might be easy to guess that<br>something like “T od Dto” by looking at word length, but “TodDto”<br>would be harder!<br>Sometimes you might not want to remove whitespace, though,<br>because then it’s more difficult to read the message after decrypting<br>it. For example, “IamMia” is more difficult to read than “I am Mia”.<br>Perhaps when testing your code, it would be nicer if the decryption<br>was very easy to read. So, in some cases, not removing whitespace<br>could be helpful.<br>This is why each encrypter has a removeSpaces setting. If removeSpaces is set to true, then the encrypter<br>will remove all whitespace when encrypting. If it is set to false, then the encrypter will not remove whitespace.<br>Note that the encrypter should never remove whitespace when decrypting, as this just makes the message<br>unnecessarily difficult to read.<br>Step 3 – Writing the Encrypter Class<br>You are welcome to complete this task in any order you like, but if you’re not sure where to begin, try starting<br>with the getKey and isRemovingSpaces methods in the Encrypter class.<br>The blue comments above each method tell you exactly what the method should do, and give you information<br>about input and output. Please read this carefully!<br>After you have written a method, it’s a good idea to check that it works correctly. You can do this by submitting<br>your code to PASTA. Even if you have only written one method, you can still submit your code. Remember<br>that you are allowed as many attempts as you like, so there really is no harm in doing this. To submit your<br>code, first make sure your code compiles (i.e. no red errors in Eclipse), then follow the submission instructions<br>at the end of this task description.<br>If anything seems unfamiliar, try looking at the lecture slides, tutorial questions and textbook sections on<br>object oriented design. Also, here are a few hints that you might find useful when completing these methods!<br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>4<br>Hint 1 If you have a character and want to check if it is a letter or whitespace, you can use the Character<br>methods isWhitespace and isLetter.<br>Here’s an example of how you could check if the character ‘T’ is a letter:<br>if (Character.isLetter(‘T’))<br>System.out.println(“This is a letter”);<br>Hint 2 You can easily check if a letter character is lowercase or uppercase using the following Character<br>methods: isUpperCase, isLowerCase.<br>Here is an example of how you could check if the character ‘B’ is uppercase:<br>if (Character.isUpperCase(‘B’))<br>System.out.println(“This character is an uppercase letter!”);<br>Hint 3 Want to get the lowercase equivalent of an uppercase letter, or the uppercase equivalent of a<br>lowercase letter? Well then, these Character methods are just what you need: toUpperCase,<br>toLowerCase<br>Here’s an example of how you could get ‘B’ in lowercase:<br>char lowercaseB = Character.toLowerCase(‘B’); //lowercaseB will be ‘b’<br>Hint 4 Say you have a character which is a lowercase letter, and you want to know its position in the<br>alphabet. For example, ‘a’ is in position 0, ‘b’ is in position 1, ‘c’ is in position 2 etc.<br>Here’s a simple way you can do it (note that charName is the name of the character you’re interested<br>in).<br>int position = charName - ‘a’;<br>How does this work? Well, charName and ‘a’ are converted to certain integers. ‘a’ is converted to<br>97,  ‘b’  is  converted  to  98,  ‘c’  to  99  etc.  (see  this  table  for  reference<br><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html</a> ). Then, these integers are<br>subtracted.<br>So, something like ‘c’ – ‘a’ becomes 99 – 97, which is 2. Ah! And 2 is the position of ‘c’ in the<br>alphabet. :D.<br>To find the position of an uppercase letter, just convert it to lowercase first and follow the same<br>process!<br>Hint 5 What about going backwards? What if you know the position of a letter in the alphabet and you<br>want to know what character it is? Well, we can do something similar to before!<br>Here’s how we could find the character in position 4 of the alphabet:<br>int character = (char) (4 + ‘a’); //character will be e<br>Why is this e? Well, ‘a’ is converted to 97, so we have 4+97, which is 101. Then, we convert 101<br>to a character and get ‘e’.<br><br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>5<br>Step 4 – SecretMessages Class<br>Now that we’ve made our Encrypter class, it’s time to use it!<br>Write a program in the class SecretMessages that creates an encrypter and allows the user to do various<br>things with this encrypter.<br>This encrypter should initially:<br> use the key  “zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy”  to encrypt and decrypt messages<br> be set to not remove spaces<br>The program should give the user 5 different choices of things to do with the encrypter:<br>1. encrypt a message<br>2. decrypt a message<br>3. check the key<br>4. change the key<br>5. change the space-removal mode.<br>After the user has made a choice, the program should use the encrypter to perform their choice. Then, it should<br>allow them to make another choice and it should perform that action. It should keep allowing the user to make<br>choices until they decide to quit. See the next section for some examples.<br>Example Input/Output<br>The following are some examples of input/output. Note that the black text is output, and the green text is<br>input.<br>Example 1:<br>What would you like to do?<br>1 ‐ encrypt a message<br>2 ‐ decrypt a message<br>3 ‐ check the key<br>4 ‐ change the key<br>5 ‐ change space mode<br>other ‐ quit<br>1<br>Enter a message to encrypt<br>Quokkas are amazing! :D<br>The encrypted message is: Ptnjjzr zqd<br>zlzyhmf! :C<br>What would you like to do?<br>1 ‐ encrypt a message<br>2 ‐ decrypt a message<br>3 ‐ check the key<br>4 ‐ change the key<br>5 ‐ change space mode<br>other ‐ quit<br>2<br>Enter a message to decrypt<br>Ptnjjzr zqd zlzyhmf! :C<br>The decrypted message is: Quokkas are<br>amazing! :D<br>What would you like to do?<br>1 ‐ encrypt a message<br>2 ‐ decrypt a message<br>3 ‐ check the key<br>4 ‐ change the key<br>5 ‐ change space mode<br>other ‐ quit<br>q<br>Quitting.

Goodbye.<br><br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>7<br>Part 2 – Descryption Decryption<br>In the last section, you made your own encrypter to encrypt and decrypt your own secret messages. This<br>worked by swapping letters around. You also saw that you could remove spaces to make those messages more<br>difficult to decrypt. Of course, if you wanted to go a step further, you could also remove capitalisation and<br>punctuation. This would leave just a big block of letters.<br>If someone handed you a long block of letters like that and you had to decrypt the message without the key,<br>what would you do? It might seem like a difficult task, but we can use a special trick!<br>Say you read a text in plain English, and found that the most common letter was “e”. Then, you read an<br>encrypted message and found that the most common letter was “z”. Would you be able to guess what that “z”<br>actually was? Probably! If the most common letter in English was ‘e’, then there would be good evidence to<br>think that that “z” was actually an “e”!<br>You could do something similar with the rest of the letters! You could get a list of all the letters in English<br>ranked based on how frequently they occur and a list of all letters in the encrypted message ranked in the same<br>way. Then you could try to match up the letters in the lists to guess the key!<br>Of course, this might not always work out exactly. For example, it might be tricky trying to decrypt a novel<br>with no e’s in it! (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel" target="_blank" rel="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel</a>) ). However, it can be useful in giving you a<br>general idea of which letter could be which, and you could try out different combinations! Generally, the<br>longer the encrypted message, the better this method will work.<br>With all of this in mind, it’s time to finally discover what the encrypted part of the task description says!<br>The encrypted message is quite short, which means that the distribution of letters not exactly the same as<br>general English. So, to make things a little simpler, we are providing a reference text to use. If you count the<br>number of times each letter appears in the reference text, and sort the letters based on how often they appear,<br>the list will be the same as the encrypted text.<br>A reference text of standard English<br>This is some sample text to use as a reference. Have you heard of quokkas? They’re really<br>cute Australian animals that seem like little roos with big puffy cheeks! If you want to<br>see one, the best way is to fly to Perth, then catch a ferry over to Rottness<em> island.<br>There are apparently about 10,000 on Rottness</em> island. Wow! Sometimes, if you have superb<br>selfie skills, you can take a selfie with them! They often look like they’re smiling,<br>which makes them very photogenic! Tortoises are also very q-ute. They have shells, you<br>see. Tortoises might eat juicy fish. Did you hear fish is ‘poisson’ in French? Tortoises<br>are better than fish. Juice is tastier than wine. Is juice a good prize?<br>Nnnnnooooooooooooo! This sentence is still strange. quip, quid, quiz, quote, quit. Good<br>dogs/ pups meet bugs under beds. Ponds. Pepper. Mind mood.<br>*Actually spelt “Rottnest”, but we needed less t’s….<br>Your task now is to finish the class FrequencyDecryption. We have written many of the methods for you<br>– you only need to write getKey and printTaskDescription.<br>What could the secret message say?<br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>8<br>Example Output<br>The secret message is:<br>Well, we can’t tell you what the secret message is in the example output, but<br>it should be in this form at least. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah<br>blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah<br>blah blah blah blah blah etc.<br>Setting Up<br>Setting up your workspace<br>In Eclipse, create a project “info1103_task3”. In this project, create a package “cryptography”. Then, create<br>three classes within this package: Encrypter, SecretMessages and FrequencyDecryption.<br>Downloading the skeleton code<br>Download the skeleton code from PASTA for these three classes. Then, you can either import these classes,<br>or copy and paste the skeleton code into each of the classes you made.<br>Methods to complete<br>Take a quick look at the skeleton code. You’ll notice that, in some methods, there is one of the following<br>comments:<br>//TODO complete this method<br>//TODO complete this constructor<br>These are the methods that you will need to write for this assignment. You don’t need to modify any of the<br>methods that don’t have one of these comments – we have already done these for you!<br>NOTE: we recommend that you read the rest of the task description before you start writing any of the<br>methods!!<br><br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>9<br>Methods already return values!<br>You might notice that, in some of the methods you need to complete, we have added a return statement to<br>the skeleton code. For example,<br>public String getKey()<br>{<br>return “”; //TODO delete this when you write this method<br>}<br>This has been done to make your code compile. That way, you can submit to PASTA even if you haven’t<br>written some of the methods.<br>When you start writing a method, delete this return statement and replace it with your own code.<br>Method headers<br>Each method has a header, such as:<br>public boolean setKey(String newKey)<br>Please do not modify these headers at all because we use them to test your code.<br>Additional methods<br>You are welcome to add any additional methods to the skeleton code if you would like to.<br>Method Comments<br>Finally, you’ll notice there are blue comments above each method, which describe what each method does,<br>what the parameters should be, and what the method will return depending on the input. Before writing any<br>methods, it’s very important to read these comments carefully, so you can make sure your method does exactly<br>what it should!<br>Submission Instructions<br>Submitting in PASTA<br>1. Before submitting, you should zip your source code files. Open the folder containing the classes<br>Encrypter.java, SecretMessages.java and FrequencyDecryption.java. If you have<br>trouble finding the src folder, first find and open your workspace folder. Then, open the folder<br>“info1103_task3”. The src folder will be inside. Navigate into the src folder, right click on the<br>“cryptography” folder and choose “Send to -&gt; Compressed (Zipped) folder”.<br>2. Log in to PASTA (<a href="http://info1103.it.usyd.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://info1103.it.usyd.edu.au/</a>) with your Unikey login and password.<br>Note: If you are off-campus, you will need to establish a VPN connection to access PASTA. This means installing<br>a program called “VPN client” on your computer and running it every time when you use PASTA off-campus.<br>Instructions how to do this are available here:<br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>10<br><a href="http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/519/~/how-do-i-download-and-install-the-vpn-client-to-" target="_blank" rel="external">http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/519/~/how-do-i-download-and-install-the-vpn-client-to-</a><br>access-the-university-network%3F<br>If you have problems with VPN, try synchronising your password:<br><a href="https://www.auth.usyd.edu.au/extro/pwresync/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.auth.usyd.edu.au/extro/pwresync/</a><br>If this doesn’t work, contact the ICT helpdesk: <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/ict/student/contact/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://sydney.edu.au/ict/student/contact/</a><br>3. Find Task 3 and press “Submit”. Then press “Choose File” and attach the zipped source files, then<br>press “I accept” (after reading the University policy on academic honesty).<br>4. If you see a message indicating that your code is queued for testing under Task 3, this means that your<br>code has been uploaded successfully.<br>5. If you see a red error box, you need to fix any problems indicated before your submission will be<br>accepted.<br>6. Once your program has been tested, the page will tell you to refresh for results, so refresh the page.<br>You should see green, red and grey boxes. Each box corresponds to a test; a red box indicates that your<br>program has failed the respective test, a green box indicates that your program has passed the test, and<br>a grey box indicates that the test is hidden (you will not see the result of the test until after the due<br>date).<br>7. If you have red boxes, you can see which tests were not passed by clicking on the task name. Correct<br>the errors (go to Eclipse, re-write your code and test it carefully) and then submit again in PASTA.<br>8.  For further help on using PASTA, check the INFO1103 User Manual, or post a question on Piazza.<br>You can submit as many times as you want. Please make sure that your program compiles and runs before<br>you submit it in PASTA. Your last submission will be the one that will be marked.<br>Marking<br>5 marks will be allocated for the Encrypter and SecretMessages classes (core part of the task) and 2<br>marks for the FrequencyDecryption (extension part of the task).<br>Your mark is the percentage of the tests that you have passed. For example, if you pass half of the tests for the<br>core part of the task and all of the tests for the extension, you will receive 50% of 5 marks + 100% of 2 marks<br>= 4.5 marks total. If you do not attempt the extension part of the test, the maximum mark you can get is 5/7.<br><br><br><br></font>

The goal is<br>to build a hand of cards that values as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. First,<br>here is the terminology used in the game.<br> Hit: Take another card for your hand<br> Stand: Stop taking cards<br> Bust: Exceed a value of 21 in your hand<br> Push: Tie with the dealer<br>The cards are valued as follows.<br>Rank Value<br>Ace 11 or 1<br>2–10 Face value<br>Jack, Queen, King 10<br>Of particular note, an Ace can be considered either value 11 or 1. Given rational strategy,<br>it will be considered 11 unless that will cause a bust, in which case it will be considered 1.<br>In each hand, play proceeds as follows.<br>1. The dealer takes one card, which the player can see.<br>2. The player is given two cards.<br>3. The player has the option to hit, or take one additional card. The player can hit as<br>many times as desired, until they reach or exceed 21, or decide to stand (stop taking<br>cards).<br>1<br>4. If the player did not bust (exceed 21), the dealer takes cards until she reaches 17 or<br>higher (i.e., the dealer will hit on 16 or fewer points, and stand on 17 or more points).<br>5. If the player busts, she immediately loses, and the dealer will not draw more cards.<br>If the dealer busts, the player wins. If the player and dealer have the same total, it is<br>a push. Otherwise, the winner is the one with higher point total.<br>6. If the player loses, she loses her bet. If the player wins, she wins her bet. If the hand<br>is a push, the bet is returned (i.e., no gain or loss).<br>In this project, you will program a functional Blackjack game by first coding the basic logic<br>of the game, then gradually adding features.<br>2<br>Lab Session 1, Feb 24–Feb 25<br>Activity 1<br>In this activity, you will code the logic of the game using simplifications, rather than tackling<br>a full Blackjack game all at once. Instead of selecting a card and then determining its value,<br>you will instead randomly generate a card’s value from between 2 and 11. You will also<br>assume that the bet is always $25.<br>Note that randomly generating a card’s value is not an accurate way to simulate draws. In a<br>real deck, there are more cards worth 10 than there are, e.g., cards worth 5. Consider other<br>ways in which this version of Blackjack will not be exactly the same as real-life Blackjack.<br>You will add features to make the game more realistic in later activities.<br>1. Write a main() function that asks the user for their name, and initializes their starting<br>money to $1,000.<br>2. Write a loop in main() that will play a hand of blackjack, then ask the user if they want<br>to play another hand (as long as they still have money to bet). You will play a hand<br>by calling the play_hand(name) function (which does not yet exist). This function<br>should return the change in the player’s money (positive if they win, negative if they<br>lose), and you should use this value to update their amount after each hand.<br>3. Write the play_hand(name) function. In this function, you will need to track the<br>running total of the cards that the dealer and player have been dealt. Deal one card<br>to the dealer and two to the player. Prompt the player for their action (hit/stay)<br>until they reach or exceed 21, or choose to stay. Then, deal cards to the dealer until<br>they reach or exceed 17. Determine the winner, and return the change in the player’s<br>money (i.e., 25 if they won, -25 if they lost, and 0 if the hand was a push).<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Dealer received card of value 2<br>Bill received card of value 9<br>Bill received card of value 5<br>Dealer total: 2<br>Bill total: 14<br>Move?

(y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>5<br>Activity 2<br>In this activity, you will improve the drawing of cards. You will use the strategy we’ve<br>learned in lecture for encoding information in a way that the computer can store it: trans-<br>form the information into a number. In this activity, use an integer to store each card, and<br>represent them as follows.<br>Rank int encoding Point value<br>Ace (A) 1 11<br>2 2 2<br>3 3 3<br>4 4 4<br>5 5 5<br>6 6 6<br>7 7 7<br>8 8 8<br>9 9 9<br>10 10 10<br>Jack (J) 11 10<br>Queen (Q) 12 10<br>King (K) 13 10<br>Now, you can randomly generate a card from Ace to King, rather than randomly generating<br>a value. You will modify your program so that you can determine how to display each card,<br>as well as what value it has.<br>1. Write a function value_of_card(card) that takes as a parameter an int-encoded<br>card as described above (i.e., an int value from 1 to 13) and returns its point value as<br>described above.<br>2. Write a function string_of_card(card) that takes as a parameter an int-encoded<br>card as described above and returns the card’s string value for printing during the<br>game.<br>For example, string_of_card(5) should return “5”, and string_of_card(12) (a<br>Queen) should return “Q”.<br>3. Modify the play_hand function to generate a random card, rather than a random card<br>value. When adding a card to the player or dealer’s total, use value_of_card(card),<br>and when displaying a card, use string_of_card(card).<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>6<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Dealer received 2<br>Bill received A<br>Bill received K<br>Dealer total: 2<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer received A<br>Dealer total: 13<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer received 9<br>Dealer total: 22<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer bust<br>Bill has $1,025<br>Play again?

(hit/stay) h<br>Bill received 6<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 22<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>7<br>Lab Session 2, Mar 2–Mar 3<br>Activity 3<br>In this activity, you will save the player’s game and allow them to resume. You will use file<br>I/O as discussed in lecture. You will save and restore the player’s name and money total.<br>1. Write a function save(name, money) that saves the user’s name and money to the<br>file blackjack.save.<br>Hint: In order to restore this information successfully, you should save these two<br>pieces of information on separate lines of the file.<br>2. Write a function restore() that attempts to read the user’s name and money from<br>the file blackjack.save. If it is successful, it should return these values as a string and<br>an int, respectively. If it fails, it should return ‘’, -1 to indicate it was unsuccessful.<br>3. Modify function main() to call save(name, money) before quitting.<br>4. Modify function main() to call restore() when starting up. If the load was successful,<br>ask the user if they would like to resume or start a new game. If it was unsuccessful,<br>simply start a new game.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage (nothing has changed yet, because there<br>is no saved game to load):<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Dealer received K<br>Bill received Q<br>Bill received 3<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 13<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received 4<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 17<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received A<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 28<br>Bill bust<br>8<br>Bill has $975<br>Play again?

(hit/stay) h<br>Bill received J<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 26<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $950<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Here is an example of the load functionality when running the program again:<br>Resume saved game ‘Bill’? (y/n) y<br>Bill has $950<br>Dealer received K<br>Bill received 7<br>Bill received Q<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 17<br>Move? (hit/stay) s<br>Dealer received K<br>Dealer total: 20<br>Bill total: 17<br>Dealer wins<br>Bill has $925<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Finally, here is an example of starting a new game even though a saved game exists:<br>9<br>Resume saved game ‘Bill’? (y/n) n<br>Name? Phil<br>Phil has $1,000<br>Dealer received 4<br>Phil received 3<br>Phil received J<br>Dealer total: 4<br>Phil total: 13<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Phil received 10<br>Dealer total: 4<br>Phil total: 23<br>Phil bust<br>Phil has $975<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>10<br>Activity 4<br>In this activity, you will allow the player to change their bet before each hand.<br>1. Write a function input_bet(bet, money) that accepts parameter for the current bet<br>and amount of money available, and returns the bet input from the user. Perform<br>input validation on the following requirements:<br>The bet must be a whole number, cannot be negative, and cannot be greater than the<br>available money. If the user presses enter without typing anything, use the existing<br>bet value (if valid). The user can bet 0, which means they want to quit the game.<br>2. Modify main() to call input_bet(bet, money) before every hand instead of prompt-<br>ing for y/n for another hand. If the user bets 0, save their game and quit.<br>Now, you will need to pass the current bet to the play_hand function, and modify<br>this function so it returns the correct change in the player’s money when they win or<br>lose.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 1500<br>Cannot bet more than $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) Fifty<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 500<br>Dealer received J<br>Bill received 10<br>Bill received 10<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 20<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received Q<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 30<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $500<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $500)<br>Dealer received A<br>Bill received 5<br>Bill received K<br>11<br>Dealer total: 11<br>Bill total: 15<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received A<br>Dealer total: 11<br>Bill total: 26<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $0<br>Game over<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>12<br>Lab Session 3, Mar 16–Mar 17<br>Activity 5<br>In this activity, you will improve the card drawing functionality even further. In real life,<br>you cannot draw 5 Aces in a single hand. However, if we’re only generating random cards,<br>this is possible. Therefore, for each hand, you will create a deck of cards, shuffle it, and<br>draw from it.<br>1. Write a function new_deck() that returns a list containing 4 Kings, 4 Queens, etc.<br>using the integer encoding from Activity 2.<br>Hint: Use nested loops.<br>2. Write a function shuffle_deck(deck) that returns a shuffled version of the deck.<br>Hint: Use the random module.<br>3. Modify play_hand() so that it creates and shuffles a deck at the start of each hand.<br>Instead of randomly generating cards, “draw” them from the shuffled deck. Be sure<br>that you do not draw the same card from the deck multiple times (e.g., by removing<br>the card you draw from the deck).<br>Unless you know how to count cards, the output after this activity will not look very<br>different. However, your distribution of cards will be more realistic. You should run your<br>program to ensure that you are still getting random-looking cards, and not drawing the<br>same cards over and over again.<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>13<br>Activity 6<br>In this activity, you will modify your encoding of cards so that it stores both the rank (A–K)<br>and the suit (♣, ♦, ♥, ♠).<br>1. Modify new_deck() so that it creates a list of cards where each card is a tuple of size<br>2. Store the int value first, then a string value representing the suit.<br>Hint: You may be able to copy and paste the suit symbols directly into your text<br>editor. If not, you can use the following escape sequences to include the suit symbols<br>in a string literal in Python.<br>Suit Escape sequence<br>♣ \u2663<br>♦ \u2662<br>♥ \u2661<br>♠ \u2660<br>2. Modify value_of_card to account for the change in encoding of cards.<br>3. Modify the string_of_card to print both the rank and suit of the card.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 100<br>Dealer received 10♦<br>Bill received 6♦<br>Bill received 2♠<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 8<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received A♠<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 19<br>Move? (hit/stay) s<br>Dealer received A♣<br>Dealer total: 21<br>Bill total: 19<br>Dealer wins<br>14<br>Bill has $900<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $100) 0<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>15<br>Lab Session 4, Mar 23–Mar 24<br>Activity 7<br>In this activity, you will modify your program to improve its output. Instead of keeping<br>track of only the total points of the player and dealer, you will keep track of their full hand<br>as a list of cards.<br>1. Write function string_of_hand(hand) that uses the string_of_card(card) func-<br>tion to return a string of an entire hand (encoded as a list of cards).<br>2. Write function value_of_hand(hand) that uses the value_of_card(card) function<br>to return the value of an entire hand of cards.<br>3. Modify the function play_hand so that it keeps track of the hands of the player and<br>dealer, rather than just the total points for their hand. Then modify your output so<br>that it prints the hands instead of individual cards.<br>4. Modify your function value_of_hand(hand) so that it correctly adds the value of<br>Ace.<br>Recall the rule: if an Ace of value 11 would make the hand bust, it is considered to<br>be value 1 instead. Thus, an Ace alone is worth 11, an Ace and a King is worth 21,<br>and two Aces is worth 12.<br>Hint: It may help to create a list of values for each card. For example, if the user<br>has two Aces, first create the list of values [11, 11], then modify it according to the<br>rule.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 100<br>Bet: $100<br>Dealer’s hand: 10♥<br>Value: 10<br>Bill’s hand: J♠ 2♣<br>Value: 12<br>Move?

Links will be provided on the eLP for<br>electronic submission of your work.<br>Marking and feedback will be available within the following 3 weeks in class<br>or via an appointment, or via e-mail.<br>Weighting towards Module 70%<br>Learning Objectives Covered The following learning objectives are either<br>fully or partially covered by this assignment:<br>1. Analyse and specify a programming problem.<br>2. Design a high-level solution to the problem using object oriented and<br>general imperative programming language constructs.<br>3. Write, compile, execute, test and debug an OO program, which maps the<br>high-level design onto concrete programming constructs, using appropriate<br>documentation standards and software tools.<br>4. Critically evaluate the methodologies and conceptual tools used in devel-<br>oping solutions to programming problems.<br>The two main themes of this assignment are programming graphical user inter-<br>faces in Java and using inheritence in Java.<br>The work is set in week 9 of the module by which time you will have covered<br>the key concepts required to complete the work. However, you may find that<br>some of the material discussed after the Easter Vacation may be of use in your<br>implementation of the program.<br>1<br>Problem Specification<br>You are going to provide a version of the loans recording system (assignment 1)<br>with a GUI and some extra functionality.<br>The system needs to be expanded to include items for sale as well as items for<br>loan. The system should hold a price and a number in stock for a sale-item,<br>and a borrower and a return-date for a loan item. Thus there will be two types<br>of Item in the collection.<br>1. LoanItem: consisting of item ID and item description plus a borrower and<br>a return date; the ID consists of the letters LN followed by a three-digit<br>number;<br>2. SaleItem: consisting of item ID and description plus a price and a number<br>in stock; the ID consists of the letters SL followed by a three-digit number;<br>You are provided with two classes as a starting point for the work:<br>• Item a class representing a single item entry in the system. This class<br>contains only the ID and description; you will need to extend it to include<br>the extra data (borrower name and loan date (a long integer) in case of<br>LoanItem and description and quantity in case of SaleItem).<br>• ItemCollection a class representing the collection of item records, and<br>containing functions to save the item data (in text format) to a data file,<br>and to load item data from the file.<br>There is also a sample data file, containing IDs and descriptions only, and a<br>Main.class which illustrates loading from the data file into the item collection,<br>and saving of the item collection to the data file. More on these classes below.<br>Requirements<br>The following are essential functional requirements of the program:<br>1. The system needs to be expanded to include items for sale as well as items<br>for loan, as above.<br>• The Item class needs to be extended to classes LoanItem (record-<br>ing borrower and return data as per assignment 1) and SaleItem,<br>recording price and number in stock in addition to ID, description.<br>• The ItemCollection class needs to be extended also.<br>The ExtendedItemCollection class will inherit the ArrayList<item><br>and use this to store the two types of Item in one list, but will need<br>extra methods to support the functions set out below.<br>2<br>In particular, the Items in the collection will be a mixture of LoanItems<br>and SaleItems; your code needs to be able to distinguish these.<br>2. Your program should provide the following functions -<br>(a) issue a loan-item on loan;<br>(b) check back in a loan-item;<br>(c) sell some quantity of a sale-item (and update of the number in stock);<br>(d) list all entries;<br>(e) list all loan-item entries;<br>(f) list all loan-items currently on loan;<br>(g) list all sale-item entries;<br>3. The user interface must be a GUI.<br>Figure 1: A GUI for the application<br>General Points<br>1. You must make use of inheritance in developing this program. This should<br>involve you in extending the given Item and ItemCollection classes. Al-<br>3<br>though you may be given the source files, your program you MUST NOT<br>make any changes to these files.<br>2. All interactions must be via a GUI. Typically you can expect to make use<br>of buttons, text areas, and text fields. Your GUI should look something<br>like that depicted in figure 1.<br>3. The program should consist of a number of classes each with well defined<br>functionality. There should be a driver class to set things going; a GUI<br>class to provide the user interface; classes concerned with the address<br>book.<br>4. Your program should deal with error conditions by producing an error<br>dialogue window when the use makes a mistake (Consider the use of JOp-<br>tionPane dialogues for the error dialogues. This will require a little inves-<br>tigation on your part.)<br>5. Input could be via the ‘generic’ dialogues provided by JOptionPane; or<br>you could try making your own custom dialogues extending JDialog class.<br>6. All classes must be fully documented using Javadoc conventions.<br>7. The code you produce must adhere to the published course coding stan-<br>dards. Failure to adhere to the standards will lead to a loss of marks.<br>8. You will be expected to test your program against a suitable set of sit-<br>uations. In the documentation you should describe your testing strategy<br>(see below).<br>Design<br>You must produce design documentation. This will include a class diagram for<br>the system, a short explanation as to the general purpose of each of the classes<br>you have produced and their key methods; and a justification for any design<br>decisions you have made.<br>Implementation<br>You must provide listings for your program. The code must adhere to the Java<br>style standards as defined for the module.<br>Testing<br>You are expected to test your code. During the module we looked at strategies<br>for testing programs. You must apply these strategies to your work.<br>4<br>The testing section of your documentation indicates the approach you have<br>taken to verifying and validating your system. Just as you should not convey<br>the design of your system by presenting the code or even listing the classes,<br>you should not merely list the tests performed. Rather, discuss how tests were<br>selected, why they are sufficient, why a reader should believe that no important<br>tests were omitted, and why the reader should believe that the system will really<br>operate as desired when in use.<br>1. Strategy: An explanation of the overall strategy for testing: Black box<br>and/or white box, integration, kinds of test beds or test drivers used,<br>sources of test data, test suites. You might want to use different techniques<br>(or combinations of techniques) in different parts of the program. In each<br>case, justify your decisions.<br>2. Test Data: A set of tables showing the test data you used for each class,<br>etc. The format of the test documentation should be as follows: for each<br>test case in the tables,<br>• a unique ID<br>• a brief description of the purpose of the test<br>• the pre-conditions for running the test<br>• the test data<br>• the expected result<br>Reflection<br>You must provide a final critical evaluation of your work.<br>The reflection section is where you can generalize from specific failures or suc-<br>cesses to rules that you or others can use in future software development. What<br>surprised you most? What do you wish you knew when you started? How could<br>you have avoided problems that you encountered during development?<br>1. Evaluation: What you regard as the successes and failures of the devel-<br>opment: unresolved design problems, performance problems, etc. Identify<br>which features of your design are the important ones. Point out design<br>or implementation techniques that you are particularly proud of. Dis-<br>cuss what mistakes you made in your design, and the problems that they<br>caused.<br>2. Lessons: What lessons you learned from the experience: how you might<br>do it differently a second time round, and how the faults of the design and<br>implementation may be corrected. Describe factors that caused problems<br>such as missed milestones or to the known bugs and limitations.<br>5<br>3. Known Bugs and Limitations: In what ways does your implementation<br>fall short of the specification? Be precise. Although you will lose points<br>for bugs and missing features, you will receive partial credit for accurately<br>identifying those errors, and the source of the problem.<br>This should be 1 to 2 pages long.<br>Deliverables<br>You are expected to submit the following items:<br>1. Your working Java classes, source code and project files (if approriate).<br>JUnit test classes and sources should be included. Your Java source code<br>should<br>(a) be fully commented in the JavaDoc style;<br>(b) adhere to the defined coding standards.<br>2. a .jar file containing your application classes.<br>3. The HTML documentation produced by JavaDoc.<br>4. A report containing the following sections:<br>(a) A cover page giving your name, University ID, and module details;<br>(b) Design documentation as outlined above;<br>(c) All the test documentation outlned above;<br>(d) Your reflection and critical evaluation, as outlined above<br>(e) Brief instructions on running your program (this will not be marked);<br>Submission is electronic. Electronic Copies of your work should be sub-<br>mitted via the assignment mechanism on the eLP (Blackboard). Separate links<br>will be provided for (1) a ZIP containing your java source, classes, etc, your<br>jar file and your Javadoc-generted documentation; and (2) your report, in PDF<br>format.<br>Academic integrity<br>You must adhere to the university regulations on academic conduct. Formal<br>inquiry proceedings will be instigated if there is any suspicion of plagiarism or<br>any other form of misconduct in your work. Refer to the Universitys Assessment<br>Regulations for Northumbria Awards if you are unclear as to the meaning of<br>these terms. The latest copy is available on the University website.<br>6<br>Classes Provided<br>Your have been given the following .class files from which you will build your<br>new system:<br>• Entry.class<br>• AddressBook.class<br>The documentation for each class is also provided but you should not count on<br>seeing the source code. It is intended that you use the functionality provided<br>by these classes without modifying them in any way.<br>To use these classes<br>1. In BlueJ create the project for the assignment<br>2. Copy the .class files into the folder created for this project. They might<br>NOT appear immediately inside BlueJ although later on you may see<br>them.<br>3. Now start to add your own classes.<br>Assessment<br>Feedback will be provided at the end of the semester, about 3 weeks after<br>submission, by inerview or by e-mail.<br>The marking for the assignment is designed to reflect the general guidance given<br>on the University’s web site for the assessment of postgraduate work. Some<br>modifications to the generic criteria have been made to better reflect the nature<br>of the assignment. The marking scheme is set out below.<br>70-100 Distinction Excellent work providing evidence to a very high level of the<br>knowledge, understanding and skills appropriate to level 7.

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>java的网络编程，主要是一个FileSender 发送类和一个FileReceiver接收类， 考察了网络编程的基础知识，CRC32 Checksum验证，<br>消息头的封装和解封，数据的传输等等知识<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>Page 1 of 6<br>Assignment 2<br>Introduction<br>In this assignment, you will transfer a file over UDP protocol on top of an unreliable channel<br>that may either corrupt or drop packets randomly (but always deliver packets in order).<br>Writing Your Programs<br>You are free to write your programs on any platform/IDE that you are familiar with.<br>Grading<br>Your programs will be graded according to their correctness using a grading script:<br>• [2 points] Programs are compilable on sunfire, program execution follows specified<br>Java commands (see sections below).<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver when channel is<br>perfectly reliable (i.e. no error at all).<br>Page 2 of 6<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>data packet corruption.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>ACK/NAK packet corruption.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>data packet loss.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>ACK/NAK packet loss.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence<br>of both packet corruption and packet loss.<br>To conclude a successful file transfer, received file must have identical content as the<br>sent one (use command cmp to check it on sunfire). Your program should work for<br>both text and binary files, and for both small files and large files (a few MBs).<br>Grading script doesn’t care what messages your programs print on the screen. It just checks<br>if the received file is exactly the same as the sent one in respective test cases.<br>• [2 points] (Who runs faster?) Time taken for your programs to transfer an enormous file<br>(more than 10MB) in the presence of both packet corruption and packet loss will be noted<br>down. The fastest batch of student programs will receive 2 marks and slower programs that<br>are still faster than average will receive 1 mark. J<br>You may apply the knowledge gained from this or other courses as appropriate. However,<br>since the objective of this assignment is to design a fast network transmission protocol,<br>you are NOT allowed to play tricks (e.g., data compression) to gain unfair advantage<br>over your peers. Please consult the teaching team if you are unsure if certain techniques<br>can be used or not.<br>A Word of Advice<br>This assignment is complex and time-consuming. You are suggested to write programs<br>incrementally and modularly. For example, deal with data packet corruption first, then ACK<br>packet corruption, then data packet loss, etc. Test your programs after every single major<br>change. Take note that partial credit will be awarded even if your programs don’t meet all listed<br>requirements.<br>Page 3 of 6<br>Overall Architecture<br>There are three programs in this assignment, FileSender, UnreliNET and<br>FileReceiver. Their relationship is illustrated in Figure 1 below. The FileSender and<br>FileReceiver programs implement a file transfer application over UDP protocol. The<br>UnreliNET program simulates the transmission channel that transmits packets unreliably and<br>randomly corrupts or loses packets. However, for simplicity, you can assume that this channel<br>always delivers packets in order.<br>Figure 1: UnreliNet Simulates Unreliable Network<br>The UnreliNET program acts as a proxy between FileSender and FileReceiver.<br>Instead of sending packets directly to FileReceiver, FileSender sends all packets to<br>UnreliNET. UnreliNET may introduce bit errors to packets or lose packets randomly. It<br>then forwards packets (if not lost) to FileReceiver. When receiving feedback packets from<br>FileReceiver, UnreliNET may also corrupt them or lose them with certain probability<br>before relaying them to FileSender.<br>The UnreliNET program is complete and given. Your task in this assignment is to develop the<br>FileSender and FileReceiver programs so that a file can be successfully transferred<br>from sender to receiver in the presence of possible packet corruption and packet loss. The<br>received file should be identical to the file sent. You may need to implement techniques learnt<br>in lecture, including sequence number, acknowledgement, timeout and retransmission, to<br>ensure that packets are correctly delivered.<br>FileSender Class<br>The FileSender program is basically a file uploader that opens a given file and sends its<br>content as a sequence of packets to UnreliNet. UnreliNet would then corrupt/lose<br>packets with certain probability before relaying them to the FileReceiver program.<br>To run FileSender on sunfire, type command:<br>java  FileSender  <path filename=""></path>  <unrelinetip><br><unrelinetport> <rcvfilename><br>For example:<br>java FileSender ../test/cny.mp3 localhost 9000 gxfc.mp3<br>sends the file cny.mp3 from directory (relative path) ../test to UnreliNet running in<br>the same host at port 9000. UnreliNet will then pass the file to your FileReceiver<br>program to be stored as gxfc.mp3.<br>UnreliNET  FileSender  FileReceiver<br>Page 4 of 6<br>(Note: Windows system uses a different file separator ‘\’, e.g., ..\test\cny.mp3)<br>You may assume that during testing, your sender program will be supplied with the correct<br>path and filename (no more than 100 bytes long). No input validation is needed.<br>UnreliNET Class<br>The UnreliNET program simulates an unreliable channel that may corrupt or lose packets<br>with a certain probability. This program is given and shouldn’t be changed.<br>To run UnreliNET on sunfire, type command:<br>java  UnreliNET  <p_data_corrupt>  <p_ack_corrupt><br><p_data_loss> <p_ack_loss> <unrelinetport> <rcvhostname><br><rcvport><br>For example:<br>java UnreliNET 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.05 9000 localhost 9001<br>listens on port 9000 and forwards all received data packets to FileReceiver running on the<br>same host at port 9001, with 30% chance of packet corruption and 10% chance of packet loss.<br>The UnreliNET program also forwards ACK/NAK packets to FileSender, with 20% packet<br>corruption rate and 5% packet loss rate.<br>Packet Corruption Probability<br>The UnreliNET program randomly corrupts or loses data packets and ACK/NAK packets<br>according to the specified parameters P_DATA_CORRUPT, P_ACK_CORRUPT P_ACK_LOSS and<br>P_ACK_LOSS. You can set these values to anything in the range [0, 0.3] during testing (setting a<br>too large corruption/loss rate may result in a very slow file transmission).<br>If you have trouble getting your code to work, it might be advisable to set them to 0 first for<br>debugging purposes.<br>FileReceiver Class<br>The FileReceiver program receives a file from FileSender (through UnreliNET) and<br>saves it in the same directory as the FileReceiver program, with a filename specified by<br>FileSender.<br>To run FileReceiver on sunfire, type command:<br>java FileReceiver <rcvport><br>For example:<br>java FileReceiver 9001<br>listens on port 9001 and dumps the bytes received into a file whose name is given by sender.<br>Page 5 of 6<br>Running All Three Programs<br>You should first launch FileReceiver, followed by UnreliNET in the second window.<br>Finally, launch FileSender in a third window to start data transmission. All programs should<br>receive user input from command-line argument only. Please always test your programs in<br>localhost to avoid the interference of network traffic on your programs.<br>The UnreliNET program simulates unreliable communication network and runs infinitely.<br>Once launched, you may reuse it in consecutive tests. To manually terminate it, press <ctrl> + c.<br>The UnreliNET program prints out information that is helpful in debugging your programs.<br>However, we will disable such outputs in speed test.<br>The sender and receiver programs shouldn’t communicate with each other directly – all traffic<br>should be forwarded by the UnreliNET program. The sender program should terminate<br>properly (e.g., no exception, no infinite loop) once transmission finishes. However, you may<br>leave the receiver program running infinitely (i.e., no need for receiver to detect end of<br>transmission and terminate, but DO remember to close the file output stream at the end).<br>Self-defined Header/Trailer Fields at Application Layer<br>UDP transmission is unreliable. To detect packet corruption or packet loss, you may need to<br>implement reliability checking and recovery mechanisms at application layer. The following<br>header/trailer fields are suggested though you may have your own design:<br> Sequence number<br> Checksum<br>Note that each packet FileSender sends should contain at most 1000 bytes of application<br>data (inclusive of self-defined header/trailer fields), or UnreliNET program will reject it.<br>Computing Checksum<br>To detect bit errors, FileSender should compute checksum for every outgoing packet and<br>embed it in the packet. FileReceiver needs to re-compute checksum to verify the integrity<br>of a received packet.<br>Please refer to Assignment 0 Exercise 3 on how to compute checksum using Java CRC32 class.<br>Timer and Timeout Value<br>Sender may have to maintain a timer for unacknowledged packet. You are suggested to use the<br>setSoTimeout() method of Java Socket class.<br>You shouldn’t set a timeout value that is larger than 200ms, or your program might be too slow<br>in transmitting data and thus get killed by the grading script.<br>Page 6 of 6<br>Reading/Writing Values to Header/Trailer Fields<br>The number of header/trailer fields and the sequence of their appearance in a packet is the<br>agreement between sender and receiver (i.e. an application layer protocol designed by you).<br>As discussed in tutorial 3, to give value to a header field of a 4-byte integer, you may consider<br>ByteBuffer class from java.nio package. An example is shown below.<br>At sender side:<br>int length = 1000;<br>// allocate a 4-byte array to store converted integer<br>byte[] pktLen = ByteBuffer.allocate(4).putInt(length).array();<br>// copy content of pktLen to the beginning of output buffer of pkt<br>System.arraycopy(pktLen, 0, buffer, 0, pktLen.length);<br>At receiver side:<br>// extract the first 4 bytes of a packet as the integer ‘length’<br>ByteBuffer wrapper = ByteBuffer.wrap(pkt.getData(), 0, 4);<br>int length = wrapper.getInt();<br><br><br></ctrl></rcvport></rcvport></rcvhostname></unrelinetport></p_ack_loss></p_data_loss></p_ack_corrupt></p_data_corrupt></rcvfilename></unrelinetport></unrelinetip></font>

In C program please.<br>The Bare Minimum<br>The minimum requirement is for a central server that can accept two connections.<br>Either client can then type a message, which is then sent to the server. The server<br>relays the message to the other client. A sample run of the program might look like the<br>following:<br>&gt; ./chat 127.0.0.1<br>What is your screen name? &gt;&gt; KitC<br>KitC has joined the chat.<br>Linda has joined the chat.<br>&gt;&gt; Hi, Linda. Are we having our meeting later today?<br>[Your Message Has Been Sent]<br>Linda: No. I’m really busy writing our paper and<br>a couple other people have conflicts.<br>&gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks!<br>[Your Message Has Been Sent]<br>&gt;&gt; exit<br>KitC has left the chat.<br>This is only an example interface, but shows the minimum requirements of sending<br>messages between the clients. A confirmation that your message has been sent by the<br>client is also a requirement at this level.<br>Level 2 Requirements<br>In Level 2, a few more features may be added. In the example above, there were<br>notifications when a user entered or left the chat. Level 2 code should add this feature.<br>At this level, the server should be able to accept multiple connections | not just two.<br>That means that the server needs to keep track of who sent a message and distribute<br>it to all of the other clients except the one who sent it.<br>Buffet Features<br>If you have time or interest, you can add any or all of the following features.<br>Private messages between clients (Something like @replies in Twitter)<br>Sending a message to a subset of clients<br>Add some pretty formatting to the messages (like colors, line wrapping, etc.)<br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>unix的IPC通讯，涉及到消息队列，共享内存等等多进程知识，是操作系统的必须课程<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>In this assignment you are to develop a chat program between two users, similar to the<br>one already available on the UNIX system called talk. When two instances of your<br>program are being run simultaneously on the system, a user typing in one instance will be<br>able to send the message typed to the user running the other instance of the program.<br>User interface can be a very simple one by using printf() and scanf() functions of the C<br>programming language. IPC mechanism is going to be developed using Message Queues.<br>Important: You should design your code so that when the user is waiting to type a<br>message, at the same time messages are being retrieved from the queue if they arrive in it.<br>This requires multi-threaded program.<br>Specifics<br>IPC Introduction and naming<br>Under UNIX operating system, apart from pipes and signals as primitive type of IPC,<br>from System V release new techniques were added: message queues, semaphores and<br>shared memory. You can investigate the status of IPC facilities on the system by entering<br>ipcs –b on the command prompt. IPC Message queues will exist even after the process<br>creating it terminates, thus it should be manually removed with the ipcrm –q <id><br>command, since IPC resources on a system are limited.<br>IPC system calls related to the Message Queues that is the mechanism of choice for the<br>IPC are: msgget for allocating an IPC or gaining access to an existing queue. msgctl to<br>control an IPC, modify its status and/or remove it. Lastly, for sending and receiving<br>messages msgsnd and msgrcv are used.<br>Once an IPC facility is created using the msgget function, an IPC identifier is returned by<br>the system. The user creating the IPC facility identified by the returned identifier should<br>specify the access permissions. Header <sys ipc.h=""> defines the IPC permissions structure<br>called: ipc_perm. Also, <sys types.h=""> needs to be included in every program before the<br>sys/ipc.h is included.<br>The unique system-wide identifier identifies message queues. To create such an identifier<br>of type key_t defined in the <sys ipc.h=""> file, ftok() function should be used. If ftok() is<br>called with the same arguments from two different processes, the same key would be<br>produced, thus two different processes would be able to access the same IPC facility.<br>For example:<br>key_t key;<br>key = ftok(“.”, 123);<br>First argument is the reference to an existing accessible file (in UNIX, file “.” – a<br>reference to the current directory is always available and accessible). Second argument is<br>some integer, referred to as an id. There are also constants to be passed as an ID: for<br>example IPC_PRIVATE that assures that returned key is always unique.<br>Creating Message Queue<br>A message queue is created using the msgget system call. If successful, a non-negative<br>integer is returned which is a message queue identifier that can be used in subsequent<br>calls that reference it. First parameter is the key returned by ftok(), and the second<br>parameter is the access permission that is of the same format as the chmod command<br>parameter. Passing 0777 would give read and write permissions to everyone on the<br>system. To verify proper access permissions are made, once the queue is created, you can<br>observe set permissions with the ipcs –b command described at the beginning of this<br>section. Furthermore, use the IPC_CREAT flag ORed with the 0777 to assure that the<br>queue is created if it does not exist or if it already exist, an identifier to it is simply<br>returned.<br>For example:<br>mq_handle = msgget(key, IPC_CREAT | 0777);<br>if(mq_handle&lt;=-1) {<br>printf(“Error creating message queue\n”);<br>perror(“MQ Sample”); /<em> print the error </em>/<br>return(1);<br>}<br>Obtaining information about the message queue<br>Using the msgctl function and the IPC_STAT flag passed to it, information about the<br>queue, its owner, number of bytes on the queue, number of messages, etc…can be<br>obtained. An include file <sys msg.h=""> needs also to be included in the program.<br>For example:<br>struct msqid_ds *info;<br>int ret;<br>…<br>ret = msgctl(mq_handle, IPC_STAT, info);<br>if(ret==-1) {<br>printf(“Failed to obtain message queue information\n”);<br>perror(“MQ Sample”);exit(1); }<br>printf(“# of messages on queue: %d\n”, info-&gt;msg_qnum);<br>Communicating through Message Queue<br>A message is defined in the struct msgbuf in the include file <sys msg.h="">. First field of<br>the structure, mtype, is an user-defined positive integer id, agreed between the programs<br>using the message queue to selectively retrieve the messages from it. Suppose, 4<br>programs (instances of the chat program) are using the same message queue, in that case<br>the following should be done to assure proper bi-directional communication:<br>Instance 1  Instance 2  Instance 3  Instance 4<br>Instance 1  –  12  13  14<br>Instance 2  21  –  23  24<br>Instance 3  31  32  –  34<br>Instance 4  41  42  43  –<br>For example:<br>Instance 1 will use mtype=12 to send a message to the Instance 2 and also Instance 1 will<br>retrieve messages that have mtype=21. Instance 2 will use mtype=12 to retrieve messages<br>from the queue from the Instance 1 and it will use mtype=21 to send a message to the<br>Instance 1. Thus, we assure that there is a bi-directional communication on the same<br>channel (same message queue) that is shared by many instances of the same chat program<br>and messages are not delivered to the wrong instance.<br>msgsend()<br>msgsend() takes four parameters and it returns 0 on success and –1 on failure setting the<br>errno global variable to a pre-specified number that can be examined to retrieve the error<br>(or by using perror() function to get a meaningful message).<br>First parameter is the identifier of the message queue. Second parameter is the pointer to<br>the actual message. Third parameter is the size of the message obtained by using the<br>sizeof operator, and the last parameter is the flags. IPC_NOWAIT is one flag, which<br>causes a non-blocking send (send would block if the queue was full) or a zero can be<br>passed if no flags are needed).<br>msgrcv()<br>msgrcv() takes five parameters. First one is the queue identifier. Second one is the pointer<br>to where the received message will be placed (receiver’s end structure should have the<br>first member as ulong to assure message type can be correctly written). Third one is the<br>maximum size of the message that can be received. Fourth parameter specifies which<br>messages should be received: an identifier used in mtype at the sender’s side or 0 to<br>retrieve all messages. Fifth parameter is the flags. IPC_NOWAIT is to create a no-<br>blocking receive and MSG_NOERROR is not to produce any error if the message<br>received is bigger than the maximum size specified. If MSG_NOERROR is not specified<br>and message received is larger than the maximum specified size an error will occur.<br>msgrcv() returns –1 on failure or number of bytes received if it is successful. On error, it<br>also sets errno global variable able to be retrieved using perror().<br>Submission<br>You should submit your C program on Carmen along with details on how to run it and<br>anything else that would allow the grader to grade your work.<br><br><br></sys></sys></sys></sys></sys></id></font>

When “make” is typed,<br>an executable program called “mymatrix” is generated. Typing “make clean” cleans all the<br>files generated by “gcc”.<br>4 Testing your program<br>You should implement BStree first and then test it to make sure it is correct before imple-<br>menting Matrix.<br>Your program should have no segmentation fault, no memory leak. Your program should<br>print all the elements correctly.<br>You should test your program by running it on Gaul. Capture the screen of your testing by<br>using script command.<br>4<br><br><br></font>
