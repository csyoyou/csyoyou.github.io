        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>linux下的c语言os方面课程，多线程归并排序统计加速比测试，测试1,2,4,8,16,32个线程的情况下加速比。代码不算难，但是要进行大量测试和统计操作。<br>并且需要对linux下的多线程原理足够清楚<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>Project 3<br>Due date: Oct 17, 2016 (No late submissions)<br>The goal of this project is to evaluate Amdahl’s law in the context of the sorting problem. The details of your implementation are as follows:<br>1.Implementation details<br>a.Your executable should be called PROG4<br>b.You will invoke PROG4 as<br>i.PROG4 <size of="" array=""> <number of="" threads=""><br>ii.Assume that <size of="" array=""> is a multiple of 32<br>iii.Assume that the number of threads is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32<br>iv.Example invocation:<br>PROG4   3200   16<br>2.When you execute the program, the following should happen<br>a.First, you will fill the array with strictly decreasing numbers. For example, if the array is of size 320, you can initialize it to 320, 319, 318 etc.<br>b.You will partition the array into 32 parts. You will sort each part using BUBBLESORT so that they are in increasing order. Finally, all 32 sorted parts will be merged to obtain the final sorted array. To achieve this with K threads, you will proceed as follows:<br>i.When you have K threads, each thread will handle 32/K parts and sort them. Now, you have 32 sorted parts of original array A.<br>ii.You will merge the sorted parts to generate array B that will represent the sorted array A.<br>c.You will verify that the array is actually sorted and contains the correct data. For example, in the above scenario, you should see numbers from 1..320.<br>3.Important observations:<br>a.You are partitioning the array into 32 parts independent of the number of threads you have. This is critical. This ensures that the actual work done is independent of the number of threads.<br>b.Normally, when you use multiple threads, this can increase the total work done. But we are trying to avoid the problem<br>c.We initialize the array to be in a decreasing order and use bubblesort to get it into increasing order.<br>d.The number 32 is chosen because cse410.cse.msu.edu has 32 processors.<br>4.As an illustration of this, for sake of discussion, assume that array A has 3200 elements. We partition array A into 32 parts, from [0..99], [100..199], … [3100..3199].<br>a.Consider the case where number of threads=1. In this case, you have only one thread. Hence, it will sort all 32 parts separately one after another. Then, it will merge it. This will correspond to the time required to sort the array with just one thread. This time will be split into two parts: the part that can be parallelized (namely the sorting of individual parts) and the part that cannot be parallelized (namely the merging part). Use this time to evaluate the value of f, the part that is sequential. As an illustration, if the time required for sorting individual parts was 200 and the time required for merging was 25 then f = 25/(200+25).<br>i.Some smart people will realize that the merging itself could be parallielized. But we will not do that in this project. The merging will always be sequential.<br>ii.Note that Amdahl’s law only considers the case where some part can be parallelized by n threads and the remaining part must be run on only one thread. It does not consider the case where you have some part where you can utilize more than one thread but cannot utilize all n.<br>iii.In fact, the merging part will be independent of the number of threads you have.<br>b.Consider the case where K=2. In this case, each thread will sort 16 parts. Each thread will sort the parts assigned to it independently (in parallel). Then, you will merge it to get the sorted array. Recall that the merging must be done sequentially. It is expected that the merging time will remain unchanged in this process.<br>5.What to turn in<br>a.Your .cpp files, .h files and makefile that will generate PROG4<br>b.A report (pdf) describing your experience with Amdahl’s law<br>i.You should consider five different array sizes from 320 to 32,000,000.<br>ii.The sizes you choose should be such that total time to run with 1 thread is at least 1 second and no more than 10 minutes.<br>iii.For chosen sizes, run your program with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 threads.<br>iv.Run each experiment 3 times and use the average.<br>v.Identify the sequential fraction based on your experiment with 1 thread. Observe that sorting 32 parts can be parallelized. Merging cannot be.<br>vi.Compare the results you have with that predicated by Amdahl’s law.<br>vii.Explain the difference, if any.<br>viii.(Note that the verification time should not be included in the time you report.)<br>6. A few things that will help<br>a.You saw that you can provide each thread with a threadID<br>b.You can make assignments of the parts to be sorted based on threadID<br>c.For example, if you have 4 threads, thread 0 is responsible for first 8 parts and so on.<br>d.You can create partitions in-place<br>7.Some more things<br>a.Your sorting or merging should not assume that the array is provided in a sorted fashion. It should work for arbitrary array. The reason I have specified the initial array in the given fashion is so that you can validate correctness of your program.  For example, merging cannot be simply put the parts in reverse order.<br>b.Merging would essentially occur in the main() after all threads are joined.<br>c.You are provided with 2 files pth.cpp – that does things somewhat incorrectly (discussed in class) and pth.cpp that does things in the right fashion.<br></size></number></size></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>写基于JavaFX的GUI界面，在assignment1的command功能基础上加上sqlite数据库和文件存储操作，同时把command的功能用JavaFX实现。实现的时候通过参数的形式区分文件存储和数据库存储。由于assignment1的逻辑比较复杂，实现JavaFX界面的时候，工作量略大。<br>JavaFX还有内置的WebView，能通过其调Javascript，功能更强大，界面更好看，如果熟练之后，开发起来比swing更方便<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>    Introduction<br>You are required to implement a basic Java program using Java SE 8.0 and JavaFX.<br>This assignment is designed to help you:<br>1. Enhance your ability to build a Graphical User Interface using JavaFX;<br>2. Practise implementation of various GUI event handlers;<br>3. Practise application of using file input and output processing;<br>4. Practise the use of command-line arguments.<br>This is an individual assignment and worth 10% towards your final grade.<br>    Academic Integrity (more)<br>The submitted assignment must be your own work. No marks will be awarded for any parts<br>which are not created by you—this includes use of 3 rd -party GUI components.<br>Plagiarism is treated very seriously at RMIT. Plagiarism includes copying code directly from<br>other students, internet or other resources without proper reference. Sometimes, students<br>study and work on assignments together and submit similar files; this may be regarded as<br>plagiarism. You should always create your own assignment even if you have similar ideas.<br>Plagiarism-detection tools will be used for all submissions. Severe penalties may be applied<br>in cases of plagiarism, including loss of all marks or, in repeat cases, expulsion from the<br>course.<br>    General Implementation Details<br>• Initial data should be read from an input text file. A Save option should be<br>implemented that writes out to a text file.<br>• All menu/interactive input should be via a graphical user interface, implemented in<br>JavaFX. All information displayed to the user should be via the same GUI.<br>• Sample GUI layouts will be put on Blackboard: you are free to have different<br>layouts as long as your GUI layouts are clear (marks may be deducted for very<br>poor design).<br>• Any incorrectly formatted input should be checked by the GUI implementation.<br>• You are to use packages: all your new code should be in packages called:<br>o gui<br>o fileio<br>Code not in either of these packages will not be considered for marking.<br>• You must not use 3 rd -party GUI components (i.e., not built by you).<br>• Marks will be allocated to proper documentation and coding layout and style. Your<br>coding style should be consistent with standard coding conventions (as in Assignment<br>1).<br>• Your programs will be marked on CSIT machines using Java SE 8.0. You should test<br>your program on these machines before you submit.<br>    Task Specification<br>You are to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the MyTi system of Assignment 1. You<br>will also make running of the MyTi system more configurable by reading initial Card, User<br>and TravelPass information from input files and write updated information to an output file.<br>You do not need to add any other new functionality to the MyTi system of Assignment 1.<br>    What if my Assignment 1 did not work properly?<br>• If you did not get TravelPass purchasing and Journey-taking working fully in Assignment<br>1 then you are allowed to just purchase a TravelPass (as in the first Sample Run).<br>    Part A: Packages and Organisation of Code (0.5 marks)<br>You should organise your code into 3 packages. A package called myti should be used for<br>code from Assignment 1. Packages called gui and fileio should contain all new code for<br>Assignment 2 (you can put some of your existing code into these packages, if necessary).<br>    Part B: Command-Line Arguments (0.5 mark)<br>You are to use command-line arguments to provide the name of your input and output files.<br>For example, if your main() program is in the class Assign3 and you read input from<br>input.txt and your output is output.txt, then you would run your program as follows<br>from the command-line on a unix machine:<br>&gt; java Assign2 input.txt output.txt<br>If you use eclipse, then you specify the arguments under Run &gt; Run Configurations;<br>however, as always, your program will be marked by running it from the command-line.<br>    Part C: File Input and Output (1.5 marks)<br>Put initial TravelPass prices and Card andUser information in a text file (the name of this file<br>is the first command-line argument); your program should read this file at start-up and<br>initialise prices and create Users with the appropriate values. A sample input file will be<br>provided on Blackboard: you must follow that format precisely, though you are welcome to<br>include more information than in that sample.<br>Your program will be tested with different values (but with the same format) so make<br>sure you can handle reading the file properly.<br>When the SAVE option is selected on the GUI, you should write an output (text) file. The<br>output file must use the identical format to input file format below. You should write out the<br>same information as you read in with the updated values.<br>    Part D: Graphical User Interface (6 marks)<br>Add a GUI for at least the following functionalities from Assignment 1. (You can implement<br>a GUI that covers your complete Assignment 1 functionality but there’s no extra marks in it.)<br>• The GUI should begin with a single window for purchasing Travel Passes and taking<br>Journeys. Buttons for “Managing Cards and Users” and for “Display Reports” may open<br>up new windows. See the sample GUI on Blackboard;<br>• The Take a Journey window should include:<br>o a list for selecting a Card id (i.e., Take a Journey on this Card);<br>o lists to select 2 stations;<br>o a list to select the day of travel, and an input box to enter the time;<br>o a message box where error messages or other output is displayed;<br>o CANCEL and PURCHASE buttons;<br>• The Manage Passes and Users screen should include:<br>o a list of Card IDs and associated User names;<br>o when a Card is selected, User details and remaining credit is displayed;<br>o an input box and an ADD CREDIT button for adding credit for the selected Card:<br>when this is performed, credit for that Card is displayed / updated;<br>o a message box where error messages or other output is displayed;<br>o an Add a User panel that obtains the required information for a new user and adds<br>them. When a User is created, there should be an option to register a Card to that<br>User;<br>• The Display Reports screen should include:<br>o a single Display All Journeys button;<br>o a scrollable text box that contains the list of Journeys.<br>o Note, if in Assignment 1 your function just displayed the Journeys for a Card, then<br>you can do this here: you’ll need a drop-down box to select the Card to display;<br>• SAVE and QUIT (without saving) buttons should always be available (ideally, outside<br>the JTabbedPane).<br>• Each window will need buttons to open the other window options: for full marks, if a<br>window is already open then it just shows it on top of the others, not generate a new one.<br>Obvious GUI errors should be checked—for example, if the user tries to ADD CREDIT<br>without first selecting a Card from the menu.<br>Sample screens will be added to Blackboard. You do NOT have to follow these designs; they<br>are simply a suggestion and you are free to design your own screens, as long as your GUI<br>functionality is completely clear.<br>• GUI Demo: 1 / 0.5 marks of the GUI functionality will be for a demo in Week 10 / 11;<br>this can be of “click” functionality that isn’t fully connected to the MyTi system.<br>    Part E: Other (1.5 marks)<br>As always, marks will be awarded for coding style, documentation/comments, code layout<br>and clarity, meaningful error and other messages, proper error handling, choice of data<br>structures and other design decisions. You are encouraged to discuss such issues with your<br>tutors and lab assistants, or with the coding mentors.<br>    Bonus Task (1 mark)<br>Instead of reading/writing from files, read/write from a database using JDBC.<br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>实现一个Wumpus的teriminal端的游戏（println），输出一个4<em>4的表格，有玩家、恶魔、陷阱、金币，玩家遇到恶魔或者陷阱就游戏Lose，捡完所有的金币就游戏Win，同时玩家可以感知恶魔 陷阱 金币的提示。<br>这个作业 时间是12小时，然后比较麻烦的是需求给的不太清楚，需要结合网上的Wumpus游戏和作业需求综合理解，设计一个简易的Wumpus游戏，画出UML图，然后code。<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>Wumpus!<br>Wumpus is a text-based game, where a player moves through a cave system searching<br>for gold and trying to avoid bottomless pits and a feared Wumpus. The cave system is<br>a 4 x 4 grid. Each grid element can hold one GameItem. A GameItem is one of: Gold,<br>Pit, Wumpus or ClearGround.<br>The player can move forward, backward, left or right one grid element at a time. The<br>cave system wraps around so, for example, moving left from position [3][0] causes<br>the player to appear in position [3][3].<br>The player can sense, but not see, what is in the immediate grid elements around the<br>player. A pit will be sensed as a breeze, gold as a faint glitter and the Wumpus as a<br>vile smell. In this assignment, the grid will be displayed, but in a real game this<br>feature would be disabled.<br>If the player moves onto a pit or the Wumpus, the player dies and the game ends.<br>If the player moves onto gold, the game score increases by one and the gold is<br>replaced by ClearGround.<br>Implementation:<br>You should write a Game class, which has a 2D array of size 4 x 4 of GameItem called<br>board for implementing the Wumpus game described above.<br>Classes Gold, Pit, Wumpus and ClearGround are extensions of class GameItem.<br>GameItem should provide a public method, display(), for use when displaying the<br>board and a private instance variable for specifying the displayed character. Gold is<br>displayed as ‘g’, a Pit as ‘p’, the Wumpus as ‘W’, clear ground as ‘.’ . GameItem<br>provides a constructor GameItem(char c) for specifying the displayed character.<br>It should not be possible to instantiate an object of GameItem. The player is not<br>implemented as an object, instead just being represented by Game as private row &amp;<br>column coordinates. The position of the player is displayed by a ‘</em>‘.<br>The items should be positioned randomly over board. There is exactly one Wumpus,<br>at least one, and up to three pieces of gold (chosen randomly) and exactly three pits.<br>The player is positioned over a ClearGround position.<br>Game should provide:<br>?  a private method setBoard(), which instantiates objects on the board<br>?  a private method display() which will display the board.<br>?  a private method senseNearby(), which displays text about what the<br>player can sense from the board elements immediately surrounding<br>the player.<br>?  a private method menu() which will provide a menu asking the user to<br>make a choice from the following and obtain the user input:<br>=====Wumpus====<br>1. Move player left<br>2. Move player right<br>3. Move player up<br>4. Move player down 5<br>Quit<br>?  a public method runGame() that will display the board, print out what<br>the player can sense, present the menu and process the user’s decision<br>according to the game play described above.<br>The World class only instantiates an object myGame of class Game, and calls<br>myGame.runGame()<br>You need to show the Pit , Wumpus and Gold when the game is being played and also<br>show the SenseNearby() field as this is testing your ability to utilize polymorphism to call<br>method of different classes.<br>GameItem display() method is used to display each game item.<br>Game display() method is used to loop through GameItem array to display the board.<br>You may find the class Random, available in java.util.* useful.<br>For example the following will assign integer variable guess a value from 0..4<br>inclusive.<br>Random randomGenerator = new Random();<br>guess = randomGenerator.nextInt(5);<br>.<br>Submission:<br>?  Due date: 9am 10th Oct 2016. Representing 30% of course assessment<br>?  This is a group assignment of maximum 3 students (prefer not solo)<br>?  You will need to submit 7 electronic files, (Game.java, GameItem.java, Gold.java, Pit.java,<br>Wumpus.java, ClearGround.java and World. Please note these must be Java source files (e.g.<br>World.java), not class files (i.e not World.class). We will not mark a class file.<br>?  This assignment needs to be well designed. Please draw the Class diagram of your final<br>coding design Please screenshot a full set of successful executions. Save the class diagram<br>and screenshots of executions in a PDF file called Design.pdf.<br>?  Weblearn is used for submission. Please zip all source files and Design.pdf into one for<br>submission (7z, rar, zipx or other compression format will be penalized).<br>?  Remember to include all team members’ names, student IDs and contribution % of each<br>person in you submission of Design.pdf in the first page. One submission one group and<br>multiple submission will be penalized or at your own risk of getting wrong marks.<br>Standard warning:<br>This assignment must be your own work. Any submission found in whole or in part to<br>be plagiarized will be given zero marks and will not count towards your assessment. If<br>an award of zero marks means that you do not pass the assignment hurdle then you will<br>fail the course.<br>Frequent Asked Questions<br>Question: I was just wondering if the Wumpus will be moving around the board as<br>well? Or will it be stationary like the position of the pits?<br>Answer: The Wumpus position is randomly generated. In each session, it will not be<br>move around. It will be stationary like the position of the pits.<br>Question: Is there only 1 pit, 1 gold and 1 Wumpus in the game?<br>Answer: There is exactly one Wumpus, at least one, and up to three pieces of gold<br>(chosen randomly) and exactly three pits. The player is positioned over a ClearGround<br>position<br>Question: Hey I’m hoping to submit and wanted to know if the tutor name is<br>important, I’m not sure who my tutor is.<br>Answer: The tutor’s name is not important. You can just submit to the default one.<br>Yes, all files need to be zipped into one file. The zip file name is not important as<br>weblearn will auto rename it.<br>Question: Is it like after generate Wumpus, pit and gold, the position of these objects<br>are settled, no matter where the player moves on the board, these objects are not<br>moving? Or, each time player moves a step, the position of W,P and G changes<br>randomly? If player is surrounded by more than one objects, senseNearby() should<br>output all information of them<br>Answer: After randomly generate W, P, G in the beginning of the game, these objects<br>are settled in position. Only replaced by “.” if player walks into it, like gold.<br>Yes, senseNearby() should output all information of up, down, left and right.<br>Question: At starting do I need to display 4X4 Grid along with GameItems like ( 1<br>Wumpus, 3 Pit and 3 Gold).I meant player basically see all gameItems position in the<br>grid (not like real game) at the beginning of the game.<br>Answer: Yes, you do need to display 4x4 grid along with GameItems at the starting<br>point.<br>Question: After each user selection from Menu do I need to display grid along with<br>gameItems position again.<br>Answer: Yes that is why you call display() method in the Game class.<br>Marking Guide:<br>OO Components 12 marks<br>Functional correct 12 marks<br>Documentation, Coding Style, Submission requirement, Error checking 8 marks<br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>主要是对文件操作、命令行操作等，输入参数错误处理，细节较多，难度的话不大。用到的知识点主要是：argc、fscanf/fprintf、loop、printf、array.<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>The following content is from a file named “instance10 001.txt”:<br>#instance10_001.txt<br>#area [0, MAX_X] x [0, MAX_Y]<br>100 100<br>#number of points NUM_PT<br>10<br>#coordinates<br>0 0<br>0 90<br>70 100<br>100 50<br>30 30<br>30 70<br>70 70<br>70 30<br>50 50<br>45 0<br>#end of instance<br>This file describes 10 points in the two-dimensional plane, within the rectangular area [0,MAX X] ×<br>[0,MAX Y]. Every line starting with a symbol # is a comment; the first non-comment line contains the integer values for MAX X and MAX Y, which are 100 and 100 in this file; the second non-comment line contains the number of points NUM PT, which is 10 in this file; the other non-comment lines present the integer x- and y-coordinates for the points, one in a line (in a non-specific order).<br>In all three assignments, the input files all follow such a file format, except that the values of the<br>variables can be different and the comment lines can be missing. Each file is called an instance, and the file name convention is to start with “instance”, followed by the number of points in the instance, then an underscore, the index of instance having the same number of points, and lastly the file suffix “.txt”.<br>That is, “instanceXXX YYY.txt” is the YYY-th (may or may not be left-patched with 0’s) instance having XXX points; for example, the above “instance10 001.txt” is the first instance having 10 points.<br>The following list contains the specifications for Assignment #1 (10 marks in total):<br>1. Write a single program with multiple functions, using the command-line options. Suppose your<br>program name is “myprogram”. If a command-line is incorrect, your program prints out the following<br>and then quits (function #1):<br>&gt;myprogram [-i inputfile [-o outputfile]]<br>2. One function (function #2) of your program is to read in the content of an instance file. To read in<br>the file “instance10 001.txt” you will execute the command:<br>&gt;myprogram -i instance10 001.txt<br>Here “-i” is the command-line option that indicates the succeeding argument is the input filename.<br>3. Your program will check the correctness of the file content (function #3) during reading. That is, to check that the first non-comment line contains two integer values for MAX X and MAX Y, the second non-comment line contains an integer value for the number of points NUM PT (this number also appears in the filename; your program does not need to validate this, but to always use the number read in from the file), and there are exactly NUM PT more lines, each contains two integer values for the x-and y-coordinates of a point. Your program also makes sure that no coordinate is out of the specified rectangular area, neither there can be duplicate points in the instance.<br>If your program encounters an error, then reports what the error is and quits; otherwise, continue to the next item.<br>4. With the correctness been checked, your program will print (function #4) out the non-comment lines of the input file to the screen, when using the command:<br>&gt;myprogram -i instance10 001.txt<br>If an output filename is specified, using either of the following commands:<br>&gt;myprogram -i instance10 001.txt -o output.txt<br>&gt;myprogram -o output.txt -i instance10 001.txt<br>where “-o” is the command-line option that indicates the succeeding argument is the output filename,then instead of printing to the screen all the non-comment lines of the input file are written into the file “output.txt”.<br>5. If your program is not fed with an input file, that is, by executing the following command:<br>&gt;myprogram<br>then your program will generate several instances (function #5) through a user interface as follows:<br>Generating random instances …<br>Enter the circuit board size MAX_X MAX_Y:<br>Enter the number of points NUM_PT:<br>Enter the number of random instances to be generated:<br>Assume the user inputs are<br>Generating random instances …<br>Enter the circuit board size MAX_X MAX_Y: 100 200<br>Enter the number of points NUM_PT: 10<br>Enter the number of random instances to be generated: 7<br>your program will generate in total 7 instances, written into 7 separate files “instance10 j.txt”,<br>for j = 1, 2, …, 7. Each instance has the rectangular area [0,100] × [0,200], and has 10 points.<br>The coordinates of a point is generated uniformly randomly within the rectangular area. And your<br>program makes sure there are no duplicate points within each instance. If it is impossible for your<br>program to generate these files, prints out what an error is and quits. All these files are saved in the<br>current directory executing the command, and your program prints to the screen:<br>instance10_1.txt generated<br>instance10_2.txt generated<br>instance10_3.txt generated<br>instance10_4.txt generated<br>instance10_5.txt generated<br>instance10_6.txt generated<br>instance10_7.txt generated … done!<br><br><br></font>

If n is the x th digit of<br>the y th line with digits, with 0 ≤ x &lt; x dim and 0 ≤ y &lt; y dim , then<br>• n is to be associated with a point situated x × 0.5 cm to the right and y × 0.5 cm below an origin,<br>• n is to be connected to the point 0.5 cm to its right just in case n = 1 or n = 3, and<br>• n is to be connected to the point 0.5 cm below itself just in case n = 2 or n = 3.<br>The last digit on every line with digits cannot be equal to 1 or 3, and the digits on the last line with<br>digits cannot be equal to 2 or 3, which ensures that the input encodes a maze, that is, a grid of width<br>(x dim −1)×0.5 cm and of height (y dim −1)×0.5 cm (hence of maximum width 15 cm and of maximum<br>height 20 cm), with possibly gaps on the sides and inside. A point not connected to any of its neighbours<br>is thought of as a pillar; a point connected to at least one of its neighbours is thought of as part of a wall.<br>We talk about inner point to refer to a point that lies (x+0.5)×0.5 cm to the right of and (y+0.5)×0.5<br>cm below the origin with 0 ≤ x &lt; x dim − 1 and 0 ≤ y &lt; y dim − 1.<br>4.2 Output<br>If not run as either python3 maze.py –file filename.txt or as python3 maze.py -print –file<br>filename.txt (where filename.txt is the name of a file that stores the input) then the program should<br>print out a single line that reads<br>I expect –file followed by filename and possibly -print as command line arguments.<br>and immediately exit. Otherwise, if the input is incorrect, that is, does not satisfy the conditions spelled<br>out in the previous section, then the program should print out a single line that reads<br>Incorrect input.<br>and immediately exit.<br>4.2.1 When the program is run without -print as command-line argument<br>If the input is correct and the program is run as python3 maze.py –file filename.txt (where<br>filename.txt is the name of a file that stores the input) then the program should output a first line<br>that reads one of<br>The maze has no gate.<br>The maze has a single gate.<br>The maze has N gates.<br>5<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a second line that reads one of<br>The maze has no wall.<br>The maze has a single wall that are all connected.<br>The maze has N sets of walls that are all connected.<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a third line that reads one of<br>The maze has no inaccessible inner point.<br>The maze has a unique inaccessible inner point.<br>The maze has N inaccessible inner points.<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a fourth line that reads one of<br>The maze has no accessible area.<br>The maze has a unique accessible area.<br>The maze has N accessible areas.<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a fifth line that reads one of<br>The maze has no accessible cul-de-sac.<br>The maze has accessible cul-de-sacs that are all connected.<br>The maze has N sets of accessible cul-de-sacs that are all connected.<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, and a sixth line that reads one of<br>The maze has no entry-exit path with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs.<br>The maze has a unique entry-exit path with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs.<br>The maze has N entry-exit paths with no intersections not to cul-de-sacs.<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2.<br>• A gate is any pair of consecutive points on one of the four sides of the maze that are not connected.<br>• An inaccessible inner point is an inner point that cannot be reached from any gate.<br>• An accessible area is a maximal set of inner points that can all be accessed from the same gate (so<br>the number of accessible inner points is at most equal to the number of gates).<br>• A set of accessible cul-de-sacs that are all connected is a maximal set S of connected inner points<br>that can all be accessed from the same gate g and such that for all points p in S, if p has been<br>accessed from g for the first time, then either p is in a dead end or moving on without ever getting<br>back leads into a dead end.<br>• An entry-exit path with no intersections not to cul-de-sacs is a maximal set S of connected inner<br>points that go from a gate to another (necessarily different) gate and such that for all points p in<br>S, there is only one way to move on from p without getting back and without entering a cul-de-sac.<br>6<br>Pay attention to the expected format, including spaces. Note that your program should output no blank<br>line. For a given test, the output of your program will be compared with the expected output; your<br>program will pass the test if and only if both outputs are absolutely identical, character for character,<br>including spaces. For the provided examples, the expected outputs are available in files that end in<br>_output.txt. To check that the output of your program on those examples is correct, you can redirect<br>it to a file and compare the contents of that file with the contents of the appropriate _output.txt file<br>using the diff command. If diff silently exits then your program passes the test; otherwise it fails it.<br>For instance, run<br>python3 maze.py –file maze1.txt &gt;maze1_my_output.txt<br>and then<br>diff maze1_my_output.txt maze1_output.txt<br>to check whether your program succeeds on the first provided example.<br>4.3 When the program is run with -print as command-line argument<br>If the input is correct and the program is run as If the input is correct and the program is run as<br>python3 maze.py -print –file filename.txt (where filename.txt is the name of a file that stores<br>the input) then the program should output some lines saved in a file named filename.tex, that can be<br>given as an argument to pdflatex to produce a file named filename.pdf that depicts the maze. The<br>provided examples will show you what filename.tex should contain.<br>• Walls are drawn in blue. There is a command for every longest segment that is part of a wall.<br>Horizontal segments are drawn starting with the topmost leftmost segment and finishing with<br>the bottommost rightmost segment. Then vertical segments are drawn starting with the topmost<br>leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment.<br>• Pillars are drawn as green circles.<br>• Inner points in accessible cul-de-sacs are drawn as red crosses.<br>• The paths with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs are drawn as dashed yellow lines. There is a<br>command for every longest segment on such a path. Horizontal segments are drawn starting with<br>the topmost leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment, with those<br>segments that end at a gate sticking out by 0.25 cm. Then vertical segments are drawn starting<br>with the topmost leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment, with<br>those segments that end at a gate sticking out by 0.25 cm.<br>Pay attention to the expected format, including spaces and blank lines. Lines that start with % are<br>comments; there are 4 such lines, that have to be present even when there is no item to be displayed of<br>the kind described by the comment. The output of your program redirected to a file will be compared<br>with the expected output saved in a file (of a different name of course) using the diff command. For<br>your program to pass the associated test, diff should silently exit, which requires that the contents of<br>both files be absolutely identical, character for character, including spaces and blank lines. Check your<br>program on the provided examples using the associated .tex files. For instance, run<br>7<br>python3 maze.py -print –file maze1.txt<br>and then<br>diff maze1.tex maze1_expected.tex<br>to check whether your program succeeds on the first provided example.<br>5 Submission and assessment<br>5.1 Submission<br>Your program will be stored in a file named maze.py. After you have developed and tested your program,<br>upload your files using WebCMS. Assignments can be submitted more than once: the last version is<br>marked. Your assignment is due by October 2, 11:59pm.<br>5.2 Assessment<br>Up to 8 marks will reward correctness of solutions by automatically testing your program on some tests,<br>all different to the provided examples. Read carefully the part on program output to maximise your<br>chances of not failing some tests for stupid reasons. For each test, the automarking script will let your<br>program run for 30 seconds. Still you should not take advantage of this and strive for a solution that<br>gives an immediate output for any input.<br>Up to 2 marks will reward good comments, good choice of names for identifiers and functions, readability<br>of code, simplicity of statements, compactness of functions. This will be determined manually.<br>Late assignments will be penalised: the mark for a late submission will be the minimum of the awarded<br>mark and 10 minus the number of full and partial days that have elapsed from the due date.<br>The outputs of your programs should be exactly as indicated.<br>5.3 Reminder on plagiarism policy<br>You are permitted, indeed encouraged, to discuss ways to solve the assignment with other people. Such<br>discussions must be in terms of algorithms, not code. But you must implement the solution on your<br>own. Submissions are routinely scanned for similarities that occur when students copy and modify other<br>people’s work, or work very closely together on a single implementation. Severe penalties apply to a<br>submission that is not the original work of the person submitting it.<br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>实现binary sequence search tree（BSST）以及实现其升级版本AVL Tree，评分点比较详细，需要做对比分析以及实现，代码实现不能使用library，最终提交code和report，应客户要求，分别用Java、C#、C、C++四种语言进行了实现。<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>Scenario: GlobalQuiz is a popular mobile multiplayer quiz game.  Each registered player has a unique numerical id.  The GlobalQuiz server maintains a list in memory of the players currently playing the game.  This list can be considered a data dictionary, where the numerical id is the key, and the player details is the data.<br><br>The data dictionary adt implements the following operations:<br><br>          proc insert ( int key) ;<br>pointer fun  find( int key ) ;<br>proc delete( int key );<br><br>Currently the player list is stored as list in an array, ordered by key.  When a player logs on to the game, their details are added to the back of the list and sifted to the correct position using one pass of an insertion sort.   When the server needs to access a player’s details, it conducts a binary search.  When a player leaves the game, their details are deleted from the list, and the remaining entries are moved down to fill the gap.<br><br>GlobalQuiz has become very popular, with thousands of players connected at once.  Its makers would like to explore whether there is a more efficient way of storing the player details.  They would like to use a tree-like structure, and are considering a binary sequence search tree (BSST).<br><br>Task: Original List Implementation: Write a program implementing the list, as described above, in a language of your choice from Java, C#, C++ or C.  Your program should contain one class implementing the ADT, and a main method or GUI which allows each method to be tested.  Your implementation simply needs to store a list of integers – the keys. [15 marks]<br><br>State and justify the big-O efficiency of each method in the original list implementation. [5 marks]<br><br>BSST proposal Describe and discuss, using diagrams, high-level pseudocode and a big-O analysis of each method, the advantages and disadvantages of using a Binary Sequence Search Tree (BSST) to implement the ADT. [15 marks]<br><br>A better tree implementation Choose either the Order 2 B-Tree or an AVL Tree, and explain, using diagrams, high-level pseudocode, and big-O analysis, how it could be implemented and its advantages and disadvantages compared to the BSST proposal.  [15 marks] Write a program implementing your chosen data structure in the language of your choice. [20 marks]<br><br>Conclusion  Summarise your analysis in a table, showing the big-O efficiencies of each of the three operations (insert, find and delete) for each of the 3 implementations.  Which implementation do you recommend for the GlobalQuiz scenario and why?   Would the recommendation be different for different usage scenarios?  [10 marks]<br><br>Further Discussion Research and describe further implementations (such as other types of tree) that GlobalQuiz could consider.  What are their advantages and disadvantages? [15 marks]<br><br>Referencing and readability of report      [5 marks]<br></font>
