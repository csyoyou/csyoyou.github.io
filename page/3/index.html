Each question is worth 20 marks. The<br>assignment is worth 15% of the total mark for CSE105.<br>(2) Plagiarism will be very closely monitored. You should be very cautious when you discuss<br>with classmates. Two similar answers will all get zeros marks or more serious consequences.<br>After the marking, some of the students will be interviewed to confirm their independence in the<br>completion of the assignments.<br>(3) The deadline for submission of Assignment 1 is: 6:00pm, October 16, 2016 Sunday. You<br>should pack all of your code with WinRAR, using your student ID as the file name and then<br>upload it to ICE. The uploading link will be automatically stopped after 6:00pm.<br>Question 1<br>The factorial function of a positive integer n is the product of all the integers from 1 to n. For<br>example, the factorial of 5 is 1x2x3x4x5 = 120. This is usually expressed as 5!=120. By<br>definition 0!=1. Write a program that calculates the factorial n!.<br>Write a program that accepts as input a number between 0 and 20 and calculates the factorial of<br>that number.<br>Question 2<br>Write a program that prints a table of temperature conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit. For<br>example:<br>Celsius  Fahrenheit<br>100  212<br>5  41<br>…………<br>-5  23<br>The exact range of data used is your choice. This is example only.<br>Use the formula F = C <em> 9 / 5 + 32<br>Perform the calculation using floating point arithmetic, but display the results as the closest<br>integer.<br>CSE105 CW1  2<br>Question 3<br>Write a program that analyses a triangle. Input the length of 3 sides of a triangle from the<br>keyboard.<br>Firstly, reject any input that does not represent a triangle.<br>Then determine whether the triangle is:<br> Equilateral - all sides the same length<br> Isosceles - two sides the same length<br> Scalene - no sides the same length<br>CSE105 CW1  3<br>Question 4<br>A leap year is a year with 366 days. A leap year has the 29 th February. A year is a leap year if it is<br>divisible by 4 except for the century years (divisible by 100). Century years are only leap years if they are<br>divisible by 400. Write a program that accepts a year and determines if it is a leap year.<br>Use a separate method to test if a year is a leap year.<br>The following information will help when you test your program. The leap years 1800 to 2400:<br>1804  1904  2004  2104  2204  2304<br>1808  1908  2008  2108  2208  2308<br>1812  1912  2012  2112  2212  2312<br>1816  1916  2016  2116  2216  2316<br>1820  1920  2020  2120  2220  2320<br>1824  1924  2024  2124  2224  2324<br>1828  1928  2028  2128  2228  2328<br>1832  1932  2032  2132  2232  2332<br>1836  1936  2036  2136  2236  2336<br>1840  1940  2040  2140  2240  2340<br>1844  1944  2044  2144  2244  2344<br>1848  1948  2048  2148  2248  2348<br>1852  1952  2052  2152  2252  2352<br>1856  1956  2056  2156  2256  2356<br>1860  1960  2060  2160  2260  2360<br>1864  1964  2064  2164  2264  2364<br>1868  1968  2068  2168  2268  2368<br>1872  1972  2072  2172  2272  2372<br>1876  1976  2076  2176  2276  2376<br>1880  1980  2080  2180  2280  2380<br>1884  1984  2084  2184  2284  2384<br>1888  1988  2088  2188  2288  2388<br>1892  1992  2092  2192  2292  2392<br>1896  1996  2096  2196  2296  2396<br>2000<br>2400<br>CSE105 CW1  4<br>Question 5<br>Write Java program to check if a number is Armstrong number.<br>An Armstrong number of 3 digit is a number for which sum of cube of its digits are equal to the<br>number.<br>Examples:<br>371 is an Armstrong number because 3</em>3<em>3 + 7</em>7<em>7 + 1</em>1<em>1 = 371.<br>123 is not an Armstrong number because 1</em>1<em>1 + 2</em>2<em>2 + 3</em>3*3 = 36.<br>This assignment is individual work.

If no interviews are<br>scheduled, no marks will be awarded to your assignment.<br>If you are an off-campus student, the interview appointments will be<br>made via emails.<br>You should show your assignment work to your tutor this week for<br>feedback/comments.<br>Exercises to work on in the tutorial<br>1. Create a class in BlueJ called Week6Q1, then add a method in it called<br>displayMenu() that prints the following menu to the screen and asks the user to<br>choose one of the options presented, as follows:<br>A. Option #A<br>B. Option #B<br>C. Option #C<br>D. Option #D<br>X. Exit!<br>Please enter your choice:<br>The method should do nothing else other than printing the menu.<br>2<br>2. Add a method to the Week6Q1 class in Q.1, and name it start(). In this method, make<br>a single call to displayMenu(), then use a Scanner object to accept an input from<br>the user. When the user enters an option (A/B/C/D/X) from the menu, in upper or lower<br>case, the program should print an appropriate message indicating which option has been<br>selected (e.g. “Option #A was selected”). There is no need to actually perform<br>any real action, apart from the printed message.<br>If the user enters an option other than those on the menu, an error message should be<br>printed.<br>Run the start() method several times to check that you have it working as required.<br>Hint : you need to use the if/switch statements in your code<br>3. Modify the start() method, this time adding in a loop so that the menu is displayed<br>repeatedly, until the last option is selected. When the last option is selected, exit the<br>start() method (ie. stop the loop).<br>Hint : you need to use a combination of the if/switch and for/while statements in<br>your code<br>The following exercises are from the text book. These will test and re-enforce your<br>understanding of the concepts covered in the week 5/6 lectures.<br>4. 4.1 (explore MusicOrganizer class the music-organizer-v1 project)<br>5. 4.2–4.11, 4.13 (using ArrayList methods)<br>6. 4.20-4.21 (for-each loop).<br>7. 4.30 &amp; 4.32 (while loop)<br>Homework for this week<br>Finish the tutorial exercises for week 6.<br>Work on (and hopefully finish) the code for the Game class for your assignment.<br>Read chapter 6 (sections 6.1-6.5, and optionally 6.6-6.10) of the text book, Objects First with<br>Java, Barnes &amp; Kölling<br>Read chapter 7 (sections 7.1-7.4) of the text book, Objects First with Java, Barnes &amp; Kölling<br>- Do exercises 7.2-7.3, 7.7-7.8 (fixed-size Arrays)<br><br><br><br></font>

Your<br>program should be in the package squares and should be based off the skeleton code available on<br>PASTA.<br>A n x n matrix is a Latin square if every row and column contains the numbers 1, 2, 3,… n, exactly once. For<br>example:<br>A Latin square of size 3:<br>3  2  1<br>1  3  2<br>2  1  3<br>A Latin square of size 5:<br>1 2 3 4 5<br>2 3 5 1 4<br>3 5 4 2 1<br>4  1 2 5 3<br>5  4 1 3 2<br>The name “Latin square” was inspired by the work of the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who used<br>Latin characters as symbols. Other symbols can be used instead of Latin characters, e.g. integer numbers, as<br>in this assignment. Latin squares are used for experimental design in statistics, for error correcting codes in<br>telecommunication systems and are also related to the Sudoku puzzles. See the Wikipedia page on Latin<br>Squares for more information (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square" target="_blank" rel="external">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square</a>).<br>Download the LatinSquares.java skeleton code from PASTA. This skeleton code contains a template<br>for your submission. You must not modify the existing method headers as we use them to test your code,<br>however you may add any additional methods you believe are necessary.<br>Your task is to write the methods readSize, readSquare, validColumn, validRow, and<br>validLatinSquare as described in the skeleton code. Your complete program will include the given<br>skeleton code and the methods that you will write.<br>Your code will be tested at the method level, which means each method will be tested individually, not just<br>by running the main method. This means you need to make sure that each method works exactly as the<br>documentation in the skeleton code describes.<br>See below for some example outputs of the main method being run. The text in  black is required output, and<br>the text in  green is user input.<br><br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>2<br>Please enter the size of the square (N):<br>3<br>Please enter 9 numbers:<br>1 2 3 2 3 1 3 1 2<br>This is the square you input:<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>|1|2|3|<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>|2|3|1|<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>|3|1|2|<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>It’s a Latin square!<br>Please enter the size of the square (N):<br>3<br>Please enter 9 numbers:<br>0 2 1 1 0 2 2 1 0<br>This is the square you input:<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>|0|2|1|<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>|1|0|2|<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>|2|1|0|<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>Not a Latin square!<br>Please enter the size of the square (N):<br>2<br>Please enter 4 numbers:<br>1 2 3 4<br>This is the square you input:<br>+‐+‐+<br>|1|2|<br>+‐+‐+<br>|3|4|<br>+‐+‐+<br>Not a Latin square!<br>Please enter the size of the square (N):<br>3<br>Please enter 9 numbers:<br>1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3<br>This is the square you input:<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>|1|2|3|<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>|1|2|3|<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>|1|2|3|<br>+‐+‐+‐+<br>Not a Latin square!<br>Assumptions<br>You can make the following assumptions for this task:<br>  Your code will only be given sensible input (e.g. ? ? 0).<br>  Any inputs will be given as integers only; you do not need to worry about invalid inputs like floating<br>point numbers or Strings.<br>How to Submit in PASTA<br>Writing your code<br>1. In Eclipse, create a project “info1103_task2”. In this project, create a package “squares”, and then a<br>class “LatinSquares” within the package.<br>2.  Download the skeleton code from PASTA and either import the class or paste the code into the class<br>“LatinSquares.java”.<br>3. Write the required methods. You may not change any method headers in the skeleton code! Your<br>program consists of the provided skeleton code and the methods that you wrote. Compile and run<br>your program and make sure that it produces the same output as the example output. When you are<br>happy with your program, you need to submit it on PASTA.<br><br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>3<br>Submitting in PASTA<br>1. Log in to PASTA (<a href="http://info1103.it.usyd.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://info1103.it.usyd.edu.au/</a>) with your Unikey login and password.<br>Note: If you are off-campus, you will need to establish a VPN connection to access PASTA. This means<br>installing a program called “VPN client” on your computer and running it every time when you use PASTA<br>off-campus. Instructions how to do this are available here:<br><a href="http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/519/~/how-do-i-download-and-install-the-vpn-client-to-" target="_blank" rel="external">http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/519/~/how-do-i-download-and-install-the-vpn-client-to-</a><br>access-the-university-network%3F<br>If you have problems with VPN, try synchronising your password:<br><a href="https://www.auth.usyd.edu.au/extro/pwresync/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.auth.usyd.edu.au/extro/pwresync/</a><br>If this doesn’t work, contact the ICT helpdesk: <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/ict/student/contact/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://sydney.edu.au/ict/student/contact/</a><br>2. Find Task 2 and press “Submit”. Then press “Choose File” and attach the LatinSquares.java<br>file, then press “I accept” (after reading the University policy on academic honesty).<br>3. If you see a message indicating that your code is queued for testing under Task 2, this means that<br>your code has been uploaded successfully.<br>4. If you see a red error box, you need to fix any problems indicated before your submission will be<br>accepted.<br>5. Once your program has been tested, the page will tell you to refresh for results, so refresh the page.<br>You should see green, red and grey boxes. Each box corresponds to a test; a red box indicates that<br>your program has failed the respective test, a green box indicates that your program has passed the<br>test, and a grey box indicates that the test is hidden (you will not see the result of the test until after<br>the due date).<br>6. If you have red boxes, you can see which tests were not passed by clicking on the task name. Correct<br>the errors (go to Eclipse, re-write your code and test it carefully) and then submit again in PASTA.<br>7.  For further help on using PASTA, check the INFO1103 User Manual, or post a question on Piazza.<br>Marking<br>Your mark is the percentage of the tests that you have passed, e.g. for Task 2: all 20 tests passed, the<br>mark is 100% of 5 marks = 5 marks, 10 tests passed, the mark is 50% of 5 marks = 2.5 marks.<br>You can submit as many times as you want. Please make sure that your program compiles and runs<br>before you submit it in PASTA. Your last submission will be the one that will be marked.<br><br><br></font>

If you already know C don’t plan on taking ECS102 to learn C.  You already know some fundamentals of programming, and you can learn the syntax of Java in a weekend if you need it.<br>   This is a closed book exam.  You are writing code without running it.  Please answer the questions in this Word document, immediately below the question.  Use as much space as you need. If you do not remember the exact syntax of a statement, make your best guess and continue.  If you don’t know how to do a part of a problem, do as much of it as you can, writing a note about what you don’t know how to do.  Send solutions to mjbaruch@syr.edu.  Use “ecs102 exemption exam” as the Subject to make sure I see it and process it promptly.<br><br>Your name:<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>  Your SU ID#:<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>__</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><br>Campus email: <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>___</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><br>Major:<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>__</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><br>ECS102 section<strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong><br>How did you learn programming? <strong><strong>_</strong></strong><br>Have you taken the Computer Science AP exam?  If so, what did you get? <strong><strong>__</strong></strong><br><br><br>1.  Write a method, convert, that converts a length from metric to British measure or from British to metric measure.  You may not assume any global variables.  There should be a parameter conv_type where the user can tell the method which kind of conversion to do (British to metric or metric to British).  There should be a parameter orig_length, the length in the original unit.  The return value should be the length in the new units.<br><br>British lengths are in inches.<br>Metric lengths are in centimeters.<br>You may use the values of 2.54 cm is 1 inch and<br> 0.39 inches is 1 cm.<br>If conv_type is ‘B’ or ‘b’ then the conversion is from British to metric.<br>If conv_type is ‘M’ or ‘m’ then the conversion is from metric to British.<br>If conv_type is any other character, then Invalid Conversion is printed and -1 should be the returned function(method) value.<br><br>For example, if we have<br>    bl = 10.0;<br>    ml = 0.0;<br>Then after the call ml=convert(‘B’, bl);<br>we should have<br>    ml is 25.4<br>    bl is 10.0<br>because 10 inches is equal to 25.4 cm.<br>2. a) I have an array with ten thousand numbers, in ascending order.  I want to find the index (subscript) of a particular number, if it is in the array.  Is it better for me to use a binary search or a linear search?  Why?<br><br><br>b) I have an array with ten thousand numbers that is unordered.  I want to find the index (subscript) of a particular number if it is in the array.  Is it better for me to use a binary search or a linear search?  Why?<br><br><br>3.  Consider the following code:<br><br>public static int mystery( int n )<br>{<br>    if ( n = = 1)<br>        return 1;<br>    else<br>        return (2 * mystery(n-1) + n);<br>}<br><br>Fill in values in the table below:<br><br>n    mystery(n)<br>1<br>2<br>3<br><br><br>4.  Assume you have access to the method<br>public static int myrand( );<br>that returns a random integer in the range 0 to 100,000 with uniform probability.  (That is, every whole number is equally likely to come up.)  You do not have to write this method, and you should not use a built in random method.  Use myrand for this problem.<br><br>You are given the code segment:<br><br>char[] cards=new char[15];<br>int i;<br>for (i=0; i<15; 18="" i++)="" cards[i]="Z" ;="" write="" a="" code="" segment="" (several="" lines="" of="" code)="" to="" follow="" this="" that="" will="" change="" the="" values="" two="" distinct,="" randomly="" chosen="" cards="" 'a'.="" make="" sure="" are="" not="" same="" card!="" declare="" any="" variables="" you="" use.="" 5.="" reads="" an="" integer="" and="" prints="" “odd”="" or="" “even”="" show="" number="" is="" odd="" even.="" 6.="" read="" string="" from="" keyboard="" print="" occurrences="" letter="" e="" (upper="" case="" lower="" case.)="" 7.="" class="" shirt="" has="" following="" fields:="" int="" size;="" color;="" if="" sh="" i="" want="" system.out.print(sh)="" size:="" color:="" blue="" (if="" size="" shirt)="" method="" tostring.="" 8.="" given="" class:="" public="" station="" {="" private="" double="" onthedial;="" callletters;="" station(double="" otd,="" cl)="" onthedial="otd;" callletters="cl;" }="" for="" main="" creates="" array="" stations="" with="" values:="" call="" letters="" on="" dial="" wrvo="" 89.9="" wcny="" 91.3="" waer="" 88.3="" 9.="" static="" findlargest(double[]="" d)="" return="" index="" largest="" in="" d.="" <="" font=""></15;></font>

All assignments will have to<br>be developed with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 using C# as the<br>programming language. No other languages will be accepted. This<br>assignment contributes to 10% of your overall grade. You must<br>demonstrate this assignment to your lab tutors during your scheduled lab<br>session in week 5. Note that you also need to submit your code on<br>BlackBoard before 11:59pm Sunday 28/08/2016.<br>This assignment is divided into 3 tasks:<br>• Creating an ASP.Net Web Application using Web Form (2 Marks)<br>• Performing basic calculator operations and converting the result from base-10<br>to base-2 (5 Marks)<br>• Counting the number of digits in base-2 number (3 Marks)<br>Please Note INFS7204 students will have to complete all three tasks,<br>while INFS3204 students only need to complete the first two with 3<br>Marks for Task 1 and 7 Marks for Task 2.<br>• Preparation<br>• Before attempting to do this assignment, you should have a basic<br>knowledge of how to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 to create<br>ASP.NET Web Forms, as well as a basic knowledge of<br>programming with C#. Please note that you need to choose .NET<br>Framework 4.6 for your assignments. You also need to have<br>Windows 7 (or later versions) installed on your computer.<br>• Hints: Please be advised that the design and implementation of this<br>assignment is totally up to you. However, you may need to ensure<br>that you are familiar with the concept of ‘Recursive Functions’ and<br>defining ‘Global Variables’ to implement some parts of this<br>assignment.<br>• Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Free Download: If you would like<br>to install the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 on your own computer,<br>as a student, you can download it for free from the following links:<br><a href="https://www.dreamspark.com/Student/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.dreamspark.com/Student/Default.aspx</a><br><a href="https://beta.visualstudio.com/download-visual-studio-vs/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://beta.visualstudio.com/download-visual-studio-vs/</a><br>Task 1: Creating an ASP.NET Web Application (2 Marks)<br>Create a Calculator Web Application with Web Form, which consists of<br>the following elements:<br>• Two TextBoxes for the user’s inputs<br>• A DropDownList for the user’s choice of operation<br>• Two Labels that indicate the result’s base system (i.e. base-10 or<br>base-2)<br>• Four TextBoxes for displaying the calculating results and counting<br>results.<br>• Two Buttons to submit the form and get the result<br>Your final application should look like the example below. However, you<br>may decide to design and implement this application more interestingly.<br>Please note that you are not required to validate the user’s input for this<br>assignment.<br>Task 2: Performing basic calculator operations and<br>converting the result from base-10 to base-2 (5 Marks)<br>In order to complete this task, you need to implement the basic calculator<br>operations (i.e. +, -, *, /). When user enters two numbers and clicks on the<br>Calculate button, the result of the operation should be displayed in the<br>base-10 output TextBox. Additionally, the result needs to be converted<br>from base-10 to base-2 system and be displayed in the base-2 output<br>TextBox.<br>For example, if user inputs 34+56, it calculates 34+56=90, the base-2<br>conversion number of 90 is 1011010. Please see the following picture:<br>Task 3: Counting the number of digits in base-2 number (3<br>Marks)<br>In this task, you need to count the number of “0”s and “1”s in the base-2<br>calculation result. When the calculation of Task 2 is done and user clicks<br>on the Count button, the number of “0”s and “1”s need to be displayed in<br>two output TextBoxs.<br>For example, as you can see in the following picture, the number of “0”s<br>in 1011010 is 3, and the number of “1”s in 1011010 is 4.<br><br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>java实现一个旅行售票管理系统，这个题主要考察学生的java基础知识，编程逻辑能力，类的设计和OOP知识，<br>功能点比较多，细节点也比较多。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>COSC1290/1295 Advanced Programming / Java for C Programmers<br>School of CS and IT, RMIT University<br>Assignment 1 – Semester 2 2016 – UPDATED<br>Due date: 5.00pm, September 12, 2016<br>Introduction<br>You are required to implement a basic Java program using Java SE 7.0 or above.<br>This assignment is designed to help you:<br>1. Test your knowledge of basic Java concepts;<br>2.  Evaluate your ability to design programming logic;<br>3. Practise your knowledge of class design and OO constructs in Java;<br>4. Practise error handling in Java;<br>5. Develop a reasonable sized application in Java.<br>This is an individual assignment and worth 15% towards your final grade..<br>Academic Integrity (more)<br>The submitted assignment must be your own work. No marks will be awarded for any parts<br>which are not created by you.<br>Plagiarism is treated very seriously at RMIT. Plagiarism includes copying code directly from<br>other students, internet or other resources without proper reference. Sometimes, students<br>study and work on assignments together and submit similar files: this may be regarded as<br>plagiarism.<br>Please note that you should always create your own assignment even if you have very similar<br>ideas. Plagiarism-detection tools will be used for all submissions. Severe penalties may be<br>applied in cases of plagiarism, including loss of all marks or, in repeat cases, expulsion from<br>the course.<br>At any point, but especially during the scheduled lab-demonstrations, you may be required to<br>show and explain your design and code to any of the teaching staff.<br>General Implementation Details<br> All input data should be read from the standard input and all output data should be<br>printed to the standard output. There is no need to use files all.<br> If the input is formatted incorrectly the execution should stop immediately and an<br>appropriate error message should be displayed.<br> Marks will be allocated to your class design. You are required to modularise classes<br>properly—i.e., to use multiple methods as appropriate. No method should be longer<br>than 50 lines.<br> Marks will be allocated to proper documentation and coding layout and style. Your<br>coding style should be consistent with standard Java coding conventions<br>(<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html</a>)<br> Your programs will be marked on RMIT UNIX machines using Java SE 7.0. Make<br>sure you test your program on these machines before you submit.<br> Further hints, tips and details, including submission instructions, will be made via<br>Blackboard and in lectures.<br>Overall Specification<br>You will implement an electronic ticket for public transport, called MyTi (My Ticket).<br> A MyTi can be “charged” by adding credit to it: initially, a MyTi has zero credit; a MyTi<br>can hold up to $100 of credit.<br> Any attempt to add credit that goes above the limit causes an error message and for the<br>charge to fail.<br> Amounts to be credited to a MyTi must be integer dollar amounts in precise multiples of<br>$5.00.<br> Travel Passes can be bought using a MyTi ticket: a pass can be for either “2 Hours” or<br>“All Day”, and can be for either “Zone 1” or “Zone 1 and 2”.<br> Prices are as follows:<br>o 2 Hour Zone 1 pass: $3.50<br>o 2 Hour Zone 1+2 pass: $5.00<br>o All Day Zone 1 pass: $6.90<br>o All Day Zone 1+2 pass: $9.80<br> If you attempt to purchase a travel pass without sufficient credit on your MyTi ticket then<br>the attempt fails: no ticket is issued and there is no charge to your ticket.<br>Your system must handle multiple MyTi tickets, each with its own unique id—the id will be<br>used to identify which MyTi ticket is being used / charged / etc.<br>Journeys and Travel Passes<br>The MyTi system is designed to automatically combine multiple Journeys in a day by one<br>User into the cheapest Travel Pass that covers those Journeys. For example, if a User travels<br>twice inside 2 hours, then a 2 Hour pass is purchased. However, if the user travels again later<br>in the day, the 2 Hour pass may be turned into an All Day pass if that is cheaper than 2 2-<br>Hour passes.<br>Each time the user asks for a new Journey, the previously purchased Travel Pass should be<br>checked:<br>1. If the current Travel Pass is an All Day and we are in the day and the pass covers the<br>journey zones, then a new Travel Pass does not need to be purchased;<br>2. If the new Journey fits inside the 2 Hours of the current Travel Pass, then a new<br>Travel Pass does not need to be purchased;<br>3. If the current Travel Pass is a 2 Hour and the new Journey is outside that time, then a<br>new 2 Hour Pass needs to be purchased.<br>TravelPass objects should store the information needed for all decisions described above<br>(e.g. whether to add a new Journey into an existing TravelPass).<br>To purchase a Travel Pass take a Journey, the system user must be prompted for:<br>-  The id of the MyTi card is to be charged to be used;<br>-  the day of travel, the start time and the end time;<br>-  the starting Station and end Station of the journey.<br>BONUS: The above means that users may spend more on Travel Passes than they needed to:<br>e.g., they may end up buying multiple 2-hour travel passes instead of one All Day pass. A<br>bonus task is implement logic that always results in the cheapest Travel Pass options:<br>1. IF the new Travel Pass means that all that day’s Passes would add up to cost more<br>than a All Day Pass—then all the Passes for that day are replaced by a single All Day<br>Pass; in this case the MyTi card is charged the difference between what has already<br>been paid that day, and what an All Day Pass would cost.<br>2. You have to do similar thinking about when different Journeys are in different Zones!<br>I’ll leave that to you to think about <br>If you try to purchase a Journey that requires a new Travel Pass, or an upgrade from 2 Hour<br>to All Day, and there is not enough credit left on their MyTi card, then the purchase of that<br>Journey must fail (with an Exception), and the user told they need to recharge their card.<br>Users<br>A MyTi ticket can be associated with one unique User. The MyTi ticket needs to store details<br>of its user, such as name and email address. A User needs to have access to their MyTi card.<br>Day and Times<br>To make things easier (and to run demos in less than real time!) you will type in the day and<br>times of Journeys (rather than using a System call to get them automatically). Using a “24<br>hour” time representation should make it easy to determine the length of Journeys. Note that<br>a Journey fits inside a 2 Hour pass if it ends before the end of the 2 Hour period. An All Day<br>pass covers all journeys that start inside that day and runs from midnight to 23:59pm.<br>Stations<br>Stations have a unique name and each Station can tell which Zone it is in.<br>Admin Functions<br>You also need to implement the following system administration functions:<br>-  On request, print all TravelPasses purchased on all MyTi cards. This list should<br>ordered by card id. For each TravelPass, list the Journeys that were in it;<br>-  Print usage statistics for all Stations: i.e., how many journeys started at each Station,<br>how many finished at each Station;<br>-  Create a new User: this requires input of a new id (the operation fails if it is already in<br>use), name, type (Adult, Junior, Senior), and email address.<br>Program Development<br>When implementing large programs, especially using object-oriented style, it is highly<br>recommended that you build your program incrementally.<br>This assignment proposes a specific incremental implementation process: this is designed to<br>both help you think about building large programs, and to help ensure good progress! You are<br>not strictly required to follow the structure below, but it will help you manage complexity.<br>Part A (1 mark): Extend existing code<br>Sample code implementing the outline of menu-based main program will be made available.<br>1. Design the TravelPass class to contain all data and operations it needs (e.g. the Zone<br>and Duration; Day and Start/End times);<br>2. Define Exceptions to handle problems/errors. These may include: trying to<br>purchase a pass without having enough funds; recharging by an invalid amount;<br>invalid menu options or inputs, etc.<br>Part B (1 mark): Class Design<br>Define all the classes and interfaces needed for the described system. In particular, you<br>should try to encapsulate all the appropriate data and operations that a class needs. This may<br>mean some classes refer to each other (e.g., the way Account refers to Customer).<br>At this point, you may just want to think about the data and operations and just write the<br>definitions, not all the code.<br>You will be submitting or demonstrating your class design in tutes or labs before the<br>due date. Details will be announced in lectures and on Blackboard.<br>Part C (3 marks): Main Program<br>Your main program should be in a class called MyTiSystem. (Of course, any class can<br>contain a main(); this is useful for testing that class.) The main program contains a menu that<br>offers the following options in a loop:<br>1. Buy a Travel Pass using a MyTi card<br>2. Recharge a MyTi card<br>3. Show remaining credit for a MyTi card<br>4. Purchase a Journey using a MyTi card<br>5. Print all Journeys made using all MyTi cards<br>6. Show Station statistics<br>7. Add a new User<br>8. Quit<br>Since we managing multiple MyTi cards, we have to enter a card’s id to know which MyTi<br>ticket to charge for a travel pass.<br>Part D (4 marks): Implement Core Functionality<br>Implement the core functionality of the MyTi system described above, except for the<br>complex decision-making around deciding whether a journey fits inside an existing<br>Travel Pass—i.e. in this version, just have the system buy a 2 Hour Travel Pass for each<br>Journey. You should be able to implement the rest of the MyTi functionality described above,<br>and run and test your system<br>Part E (1 marks): Include Multiple Journeys in Travel Passes<br>Implement the logic that decides whether a new Journey fits inside an existing Travel Pass or<br>whether the user needs to buy a new Travel Pass for that Journey.<br>Demos (1 mark each – 2 marks total)<br>You are required to demonstrate your progress and final solution to the teaching staff twice.<br>Details will be made available during lectures and on Blackboard.<br>Other (3 marks)<br>Marks will be awarded for coding style, documentation/comments, code layout and clarity,<br>meaningful error and other messages, proper error handling, choice of data structures and<br>other design decisions. You are encouraged to discuss such issues with your tutors and lab<br>assistants, or with the coding mentors.<br>Bonus (1.5 marks each)<br> Implement logic, or “business rules”, for combining Travel Passes so that the user is<br>charged the cheapest Travel Pass that fits their day of travel. You are welcome to discuss<br>the logic and different conditions via Blackboard Discussion boards; however, every<br>student must implement the final Java solution by themselves.<br> There will be another bonus task announced later on for students that would like to<br>challenge themselves further.<br>Test Data<br>Your program MUST include the following test items: just create them in your main program<br>and use them to populate your data structures that keep track of all such items. These will be<br>used to test/mark your program so it’s crucial that you enter them. You may add further Users<br>and Stations if you wish, but you must add at least the ones below.<br> Users (id, type, name, email)<br>o lc, Lawrence Cavedon, lawrence.cavedon@rmit.edu.au<br> Stations (name, zone)<br>o Central, 1<br>o Flagstaff, 1<br>o Richmond, 1<br>o Lilydale, 2<br>o Epping, 2<br>Sample Test Runs<br>Sample runs demonstrating behaviour of the system will be provided on Blackboard.<br>Submission<br>Assignment submission will be via Blackboard, by 5.00pm, Monday September 12 2016.<br>You can submit your assignment as many times as you want before the due date. Each<br>submission will overwrite any previous submissions.<br>1. You need to submit a class diagram (in pdf, gif or jpeg format).<br>2. You are required to submit your .java files weekly via Blackboard. Your progress will<br>be taken into consideration in marking. Further details will follow.<br>3. You must include a README file. This should describe how to run your program,<br>what extra functionality you implemented, any standard functionality you know does<br>not work, and any problems or assumptions. If the tutors have any problem running<br>your program and the README does not help then you will lose marks.<br>4. There will also be demos for this assignment. You will be asked to demonstrate your<br>progress and/or explain your design. Details of the demo will be announced on<br>Blackboard and in lectures.<br>5. For the code submission, you must include only the source files in your submission<br>(do not submit any *.class files!). Your code must on under RMIT UNIX machines.<br>6. Late final submissions will incur a penalty of 10% per day. Submissions made 5 days<br>after the due date will receive no marks.<br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>用python实现二叉搜索数的功能，在原来的模板基础上，增加题目要求写的方法，实现功能并且最后完成测试<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>You may begin this assignment with the sample BST code.<br>Add the following functionality to the code:<br>1.  Modify the code so that each node stores not only a number (which is used as the sort value (or “key”) of the node), but also a string containing the name of a person.  So, the root node of a BST may contain for its data:  [40, “Wendy”], the left child of the root may be [18, “Carol”].   Modify all functions that this change affects.<br>2.  Add a function called “changeLeaves” which changes the person’s name contained in the leaf nodes to “Leif”.    Recall that a leaf node is one that has no children.  Your function should take one parameter, the root of a BST, and it should return the root of the (changed) tree.<br>3. Add a function called “countNodes” that counts the number of nodes that contain names starting with “w” or “W”.  Your function should take one parameter, the head of a BST and it should return the number of nodes matching the given condition.<br>4. Add a function called “printReverse” that prints all the nodes in reverse order.  That is, the node with the largest numerical value is printed first and the node with the smallest numerical value is printed last.  Your function should take as a parameter the root of a BST and it should return nothing.<br>5. Write a function that will convince the TA that your code works.  Be sure to explain what you are showing.  You should cover special cases such as empty trees.<br>What to Submit<br>Submit a single file containing your entire program.  DO NOT ZIP THE FILE. You do not need to include the data file.  We will test your program on a different grid.<br>Be sure you document your program appropriately.  Each function should include a header comment explaining what the function does, what the parameters are and what it returns.<br>Marking<br>The assignment will be marked using a rubric.  Rubrics provide a guide to the TAs however they are not all inclusive.  We may deduct marks for unanticipated errors.<br>I do not give extensions on assignments.   A 24 hour extension is available to everyone but comes with a 2 mark penalty.  Please do not ask for another extension unless you have a very, very good reason.<br>Academic Integrity<br>Please refer to the notes on Academic Integrity.  It is ok (and encouraged) to talk about solutions with your friends but please do your own work.  It is also ok to take snippits of code from the internet as long as the code does not solve the entire problem.  If you use snippits of code, please document it in your comments by adding a URL indicating where the code came from.<br><br>“””<br>This module implements binary search trees.<br>The tree elements may be of any type.  Duplicates are not allowed.<br><br>Example for CISC 121<br><br>“””<br><br># A BST node is a dict with three elements:<br># 1. data: the value in the node<br># 2. left: a reference to the left subtree<br># 3. right: a reference to the right subtree<br><br># Prints an indented display of the tree – useful for debugging.<br># The output will look kind of like a sideways version of a drawing<br># of the tree.<br>def display(tree, indent=0):<br>    if tree == None: # empty<br>        pass<br>    else:<br>        # right tree first (so it’s on the right when you tilt your<br>        # head to the left to look at the display)<br>        display(tree[‘right’],indent+1)<br>        print(“    “ * indent + str(tree[‘data’]))<br>        # now the left tree<br>        display(tree[‘left’],indent+1)<br><br><br><br># adds a value to a BST and returns a pointer to the modified BST<br>def add(tree, value):<br>    if tree == None:<br>        return {‘data’:value, ‘left’:None, ‘right’:None}<br>    elif value &lt; tree[‘data’]:<br>        tree[‘left’] = add(tree[‘left’],value)<br>        return tree<br>    elif value &gt; tree[‘data’]:<br>        tree[‘right’] = add(tree[‘right’],value)<br>        return tree<br>    else: # value == tree[‘data’]<br>        return tree # ignore duplicate<br><br>def printValues(tree):<br>    if tree == None:<br>        return<br>    printValues(tree[‘left’])<br>    print(tree[‘data’])<br>    printValues(tree[‘right’])<br><br>def main():<br>    myTree = None  #create an empty tree<br>    #Create a tree with the nodes [20, 2, 25, 14, 1, 23, 75, 93, 74]<br>    #Note that the add function always returns the root of the BST!<br>    myTree = add(myTree, 20)<br>    myTree = add(myTree, 2)<br>    myTree = add(myTree, 25)<br>    myTree = add(myTree, 14)<br>    myTree = add(myTree, 1)<br>    myTree = add(myTree, 23)<br>    myTree = add(myTree, 75)<br>    myTree = add(myTree, 93)<br>    myTree = add(myTree, 74)<br><br>    display(myTree, 0)<br>    printValues(myTree)<br><br><br>main()<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font>
