The games have been<br>scheduled to begin on Saturday 8th October 2016, competitors are busy training and now it’s time to<br>prepare to sell spectator tickets.<br>Your task is to design, develop and test a small application for recording ticket sales to this event.<br>Stage 1: Design<br>This stage requires you to prepare documentation that describes the function of the program and how<br>it is to be tested. There is no coding or code testing involved in this stage. A document template has<br>been provided for your use.<br>Requirements:<br>1) Read through Stage 2: Program Development to obtain details of the requirements of this<br>program.<br>2) Write an algorithm that describes how the program will operate.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced – must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. The algorithm must be structured logically so that the program would function correctly.<br>3) Prepare and document test cases that can be used to check that the program works correctly,<br>once it has been coded. You do NOT need to actually run the test cases in this stage; this will<br>occur in Stage 3: Testing.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced, must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. Make sure the test cases include checking of data entered by the user to make sure that<br>only valid data is accepted. If the user enters invalid data, the user should be informed of<br>this and given another chance to enter the data. NB: As we have not covered exception<br>handling, you may assume that the user will always enter an integer.<br>c. Test cases should be documented using a template like the one below. You may include<br>extra information if you wish. At this stage, the Actual Result column will be left blank.<br>Test Case  Expected Result  Actual Result<br>The user selects to purchase adult<br>tickets.<br>The user is prompted to<br>enter the number of<br>tickets to purchase.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 3 of 9<br>Stage 2: Program Development<br>Using the Design Documentation to assist you, develop a Java program that records spectator ticket<br>sales at the gate for the Federation University Australia Olympic Games, implementing the<br>requirements outlined in this section. These requirements have been broken into three groups:<br>  Base Functionality includes the minimal level of requirements to achieve the essential<br>components of this assignment. This group of requirements focuses on getting the code to<br>work and on using the programming constructs we cover in class. You can expect to use<br>constants, variables, loops, conditional statements and arithmetic operators for these<br>requirements and you should look for opportunities to use these wherever you can. You will not<br>receive full marks for implementing a requirement, even if it works, if you have not used the<br>appropriate programming construct to do so.<br>At this level, you can decide if it is easier for you to code everything within a single method, or<br>to modularize it straight away.<br>  Standard Functionality ensures the code is modularized, and that method calls are used to<br>ensure the program flows correctly. It allows data to pass from one method to another as<br>parameters. It also includes providing a running total of tickets within an order, which is not<br>essential for getting the program to work, but is useful information for the user to see.<br>  Advanced Functionality provides a challenge task, and is best left until all the other requirements<br>have been addressed. It requires looking at a Java API to find out how to use a class we have<br>not covered in the course, and using this to provide a countdown of days remaining until the<br>games commence.<br>All three groups require that you follow coding conventions, such as proper layout of code, using<br>naming conventions and writing meaningful comments throughout your program.<br>Base Functionality:<br>1. Display a welcome message when the program starts<br>  The welcome message should have a row of asterisks at the top and the bottom, just long<br>enough to extend over the text. Hint: Use a For loop for this.<br>  The first line of the message should read “FEDERATION UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIA<br>OLYMPICS” and be approximately centred in the row of asterisks by printing white space<br>first. Hint: Can you modify the For loop from the previous step to print the white spaces?<br>  A second line of the message should be blank.<br>  The third line should read “Developed by” followed by your name and a comma, then “<br>student ID ”, then your student id, then finally “ for ITECH1000 Sem 2 2016”.<br>  The fourth line should be blank.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 4 of 9<br>2. Provide a menu from which the user can select to Purchase Tickets, View Ticket Sales or Exit.<br>This menu should be repeated each time after the user has chosen and completed an option until<br>the user chooses to Exit. The user selects an option by entering the number next to it. If an<br>invalid number is selected, the user is advised and shown the menu again to make another<br>selection.<br>3. When the user selects the Purchase Tickets option, provide another menu from which the user<br>can select General Admission Tickets, Student Tickets, Finalise Order or Cancel Order. The user<br>selects an option by entering the number next to it. If an invalid number is selected, the user is<br>advised and shown the menu again to make another selection.<br>a. Should the user select General Admission Tickets or Student Tickets, they are prompted<br>to enter the Number of Tickets required. After entering the number of tickets required,<br>they are returned to the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that they may choose to purchase<br>additional tickets. The user may not choose to purchase a negative number of tickets, but<br>a purchase of 0 tickets is permitted.<br>b. Should the user select Finalise Order:<br>i. The sale is processed by displaying the number of each type of ticket purchased<br>and the total cost of the tickets in this order. A General Admission ticket costs<br>$13.50; a Student ticket costs $7.75.<br>ii. A record is kept of the total cost of tickets sold, the total number of adult tickets<br>sold and the total number of child tickets sold. This is a combined total from all<br>orders; there is no need to keep a record of the number of tickets in each<br>individual order.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 5 of 9<br>iii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>c. Should the user select Cancel Order:<br>i. The order is cancelled and a message displayed to confirm this to the user.<br>ii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>4. When the user selects the View Ticket Sales option, display the total value of ticket sales and both<br>the total number of adult tickets and the total number of child tickets sold across ALL orders.<br>Highlight this message display with a row of 50 asterisks before and after the message. After the<br>final row of asterisks, redisplay the menu from Step 2.<br>5. When the user selects Exit System, quit the program with a message to the user.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 6 of 9<br>Standard Functionality:<br>6. Update the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that a running total of tickets included in an order is<br>displayed until the order is finalized<br>7. Modularize the code, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods as<br>parameters.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>8. Update the Welcome Message to include a countdown of the number of days to go until the<br>games begin.<br>a. Use the GregorianCalendar class to manage your dates. You will need to import<br>java.util.GregorianCalendar to use this library.<br>b. The countdown must be calculated based on the number of days between the time the<br>program runs, and Saturday 8th October 2016.<br>c. There is no pre-defined method for finding the difference between two dates in this library.<br>You will need to develop your own, using the features of the GregorianCalendar class.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 7 of 9<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Using a copy of the test cases developed in Stage 1: Design, test the program you have developed in<br>Stage 2: Program Development. Document your results, including both failed and successful tests.<br>Note: Please do not leave out any failed tests. If your testing highlights that your program has not<br>worked correctly, then the failed tests help to demonstrate that you have been testing your program<br>properly.<br>To show that you have tested your program, include small (but readable) screen captures in your<br>Actual Results as well as any explanatory comments. Microsoft Windows includes a Snipping Tool<br>that is useful for taking captures of the relevant parts of the screen.<br>You may test your program in phases if you wish. Stage 2: Program Development provides three<br>separate groups of functionality in the requirements, working from the minimal level of requirements<br>through to more advanced concepts. Each of these groups can be tested individually.<br>Base Functionality:<br>This phase requires you to check that the base functions (displaying welcome message when the<br>program starts, showing a menu of options until the user chooses to exit, purchasing tickets, viewing<br>ticket sales and exiting the system) have been implemented.<br>Standard Functionality:<br>In addition to the Base Functionality, this section includes displaying a running total of tickets that have<br>been added to an order until such time as the order has been finalized. This new functionality must<br>also be tested.<br>If you originally wrote and tested the Base Functionality by including all the code in a single method,<br>this phase also requires that you modularize your code, and use method calls and pass data between<br>methods to ensure your program still runs correctly. This means all your code will need to be re-<br>tested to ensure that all the previous functionality still works.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>This phase requires testing the code that calculates and displays the number of days until the games<br>comments in the welcoming message shown when the program starts.<br>Submission<br>Your program code and testing documentation should be zipped into a single file and loaded into the<br>Assignment Box provided in Moodle by the due date and time.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 8 of 9<br>Marking Criteria/Rubric<br>Task<br>Available<br>Marks<br>Student<br>Mark<br>Stage 1: Design Documentation<br>Development of an algorithm describing how the program should function<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Logical structure  1<br>Documented test cases to validate program<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Data is validated to ensure user entries are appropriate and incorrect user entries<br>are handled smoothly<br>1<br>Stage 2: Program Development<br>A Java program addressing the requirements outlined in the Assignment Details section,<br>including appropriate use of loops, conditional statements, constants and variables:<br>Use of coding conventions throughout entire program, including readable and clear layout,<br>following naming conventions and including meaningful and appropriate comments.<br>1<br>Base Functionality:<br>  Display of a welcome message when the program starts  1<br>  Menu displayed until user chooses to exit  1<br>  Purchase Tickets option to select and order a user-selected combination of general<br>admission and student tickets<br>2<br>  View Ticket Sales to display the total value of ticket sales and both the total number<br>of general admission tickets and the total number of student tickets sold<br>1<br>  Exit System to quit the program with a message to the user  1<br>Standard Functionality:<br>  Running total of tickets included in an order displayed in the Purchase Tickets menu<br>until the order is finalised<br>1<br>  Code modularized, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods  2<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>  Countdown of days to go until the games commence included in the welcome<br>message<br>3<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Documented test results clearly showing all the testing that has been conducted and the<br>results of this testing.<br>  Testing of base functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of standard functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of advanced functionality<br>1<br>Total  20<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 9 of 9<br>Feedback<br>Assignments will be marked within 2 weeks of submission.

The two major tasks are outlined below.<br>Provided With:<br>You are given a file called Assignment1.java that contains a main method. Use this class to run<br>the code you write. Your code must work with this file; you cannot alter this file as a means of making<br>your code work. The marker will use a file similar to this to test the functionality of your code.<br>You are also provided two files called ThingToWriteFile.java and ThingToReadFile.java. These<br>classes are provided to make fileIO easier. Have a look at the code to understand how to use these<br>objects.<br>Two text files are included. One contains the country information (data.txt) and the other<br>contains the country/continent information (continent.txt). NOTE: Both of these files have a header<br>line!<br>On the last page of this assignment you are provided with an example output. Reference this for<br>text formatting.<br>You may assume all data is correct and that there are no errors in the data files (don’t worry<br>about exceptions, or validating inputs, etc.).<br>Stuff To Do:<br>1. Implement a Country class:<br>• The purpose of this object is to represent a country. This object will store some<br>important information about the country and will have a small number of simple<br>methods.<br>• This class will contain variables for the country name, population, area, and continent in<br>which it exists.<br>• You will need to write a constructor for the object. This constructor should take a name,<br>population, area, and continent as parameters.<br>• Write getter methods for the four instance variables (getName, etc.).<br>• Write a method called getPopDensity to return the country’s population density<br>(population/area).<br>• Write a single setter method for the population instance variable (setPopulation).<br>• Write a method called writeToFile which takes a ThingToWriteFile object as a<br>parameter. This method must write some country details to the provided<br>ThingToWriteFile object provided. Below is an example of how to print the details to<br>file (commas are important):<br>i. NAME, CONTINENT, POPULATION, POPULATION DENSITY<br>ii. Ex: Canada, North America, 34207000, 3.428881310807587<br>• Write a method printCountryDetails that prints some country details to the user:<br>i. NAME is located in CONTINENT has a population of POPULATION an area<br>of AREA and has a population density of GETPOPDENSITY<br>ii. Ex: Canada is located in North America has a population of 34207000, an area<br>of 9976140.0, and has a population density of 3.428881310807587<br>• Write a toString method which simply returns a string in this format (include a new line<br>character at the end):<br>i. NAME in CONTINENT<br>ii. Canada in North America<br>Test all your classes and methods before moving to the next section. Feel free to create other<br>helper methods if necessary.<br>2. Implement a CountryCatalogue class:<br>• The class should have a few important instance variables:<br>i. A final int called DEFAULT_SIZE which is equal to 5. This variable will be<br>used when the catalogue array is instantiated.<br>ii. A final int called NOT_FOUND which is equal to -1. This will be used as a flag<br>for some of our methods.<br>iii. A country array called catalogue which will store a bunch of countries.<br>iv. An int which stores the number of countries currently in the catalogue<br>v. A set of <strings> called continents. This set will store the continents. Don’t<br>know how to create a set in java? Look up the java docs, or just Google “Java<br>sets”. This set will make one of the below methods easier to implement.<br>vi. A <string, string=""> Map (dictionary) called cDict which will map a country name<br>to a continent. This will be used to make some of the below methods easier to<br>implement.<br>• Write the constructor (this gets a little complex). The constructor should:<br>i. Take two strings as parameters. One string will be the name of the file<br>containing the country information, and the other will be the name of the file<br>containing the continent information.<br>ii. Instantiate the instance variables.<br>iii. Read the country file (with a ThingToReadFile object) one line at a time, parse<br>the text, create a Country object based on the text, and then add the Country to<br>the catalogue with a method called addCatalogue (more on this below). Be sure<br>to close the file when done.<br>iv. Read the continent file (with a ThingToReadFile object) one line at a time, parse<br>the text, and then add the details to cDict and continents. Be sure to close the file<br>when done.<br>• Write a private method called addCatalogue which takes a country as a parameter. This<br>method only adds the provided country to the catalogue. However, we may have a<br>problem, the catalogue may be full! For this method, don’t worry about adding<br>duplicate countries.<br>• Write a private method called expandCapacity that will double the size of the catalogue<br>array. This method can be called by addCatalogue if there is no more room for a new<br>county to be added.<br>• Write a method called addCountry which takes a country as a parameter. This method<br>should add the provided country object to the catalogue and update the continents set<br>and cDict map. This method can call addCatalogue. For this method, don’t worry about<br>adding duplicate countries.<br>• Write a method getCountry that takes an index as a parameter and returns a Country<br>object from the indexed location in the catalogue. This method should return null if the<br>index provided is inadmissible.<br>• Write a method printCountryCatalogue which simply calls the toString method for each<br>Country currently in the catalogue instance variable.<br>• Write a method filterCountriesByContinent which will print out all the countries from a<br>specified continent (just use the county’s toString method). This method will take a<br>String representing the continent we want the countries from.<br>• Write a method searchCatalogue which takes a String of a name of a country we want<br>to find. This method will return an int representing the index of the found country in<br>catalogue. If the item is not in the list, return NOT_FOUND. Print some sort of<br>notification to the user if the country was not found.<br>• Write a method removeCountry which takes a String of a name of a country we want to<br>remove from the catalogue. This method can use searchCatalogue. Print some<br>notification to the user whether or not the item was successfully removed or not.<br>• Write a method setPopulationOfACountry which takes a String representing the name of<br>a country we want to alter and an int representing the new population. This method can<br>call searchCatalogue. Print some notification to the user whether or not the item was<br>successfully altered or not.<br>• Write a method saveCountryCatalogue which will write the catalogue’s county’s to file.<br>This method takes a String representing the name of the file we want to save the details<br>to. This method can simply call the Country’s writeToFile method.<br>• Write a method findCountryWithLargestPop which will return the index location of the<br>country with the largest population currently in the catalogue.<br>• Write a method findCountryWithSmallestArea which will return the index location of<br>the country with the smallest area currently in the catalogue.<br>• Write a method printCountriesFilterDensity which prints out some country details if the<br>country lies within some specified population density range. This method takes two<br>integers specifying the range inclusively (low and high). This method will have some<br>additional bookkeeping. See the example output provided below for a demonstration of<br>how this output should look.<br>• Write a method findMostPopulousContinent which prints out the continent, and the total<br>population of that continent (based only on the countries in the catalogue) of the<br>continent with the largest population. See the example output provided below for a<br>demonstration of how this output should look.<br>Test all your classes and methods. Feel free to create other helper methods if necessary.<br>FAQ:<br>• Q: How do I compare strings? Can I just use == ?<br>o A: NO! DO NOT USE ==!!!!!!!!!!! Comparing Strings in Java is… very weird actually<br>(and actually the subject of some debate). Use a method called equals instead. For<br>example:<br>? SomeString.equals(SomeOtherString) will be true if the Strings are the same.<br>• Q: Why can’t I use == then?<br>o A: It’s complicated. I’ll go into this later in the course.<br>• Q: I don’t know how to do X?<br>o A: Try going to www.google.ca and then typing X into the big text box.<br>• Q: How do we use Maps (dictionaries) in Java?<br>o A: The idea is similar to python, but there are some Java-isms here. First, check out the<br>java docs for Maps (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html</a>).<br>You’ll need to import the library they are defined in. Also, try looking up examples of<br>people using them. Instantiating them is a little weird (more details on this later in the<br>course, for now you’ll have to just type the magic code) (HINT for instantiation:<br>hashmap). Iterating through them is different too; try Googling how to iterate through a<br>map in java.<br>• Q: How do we use Sets in Java?<br>o A: Basically exactly the same answer above, but the java docs are different<br>(<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html</a>)<br>• Q: How do I parse a String in Java?<br>o A: Try looking up “splitting a string in java” with Google.<br>• Q: I swear I did everything right, but for some reason my files won’t open!<br>o A: This isn’t uncommon.<br>? If you’re using eclipse, try putting the .txt files in the project directory (the same<br>folder containing the bin folder, src folder.<br>? If you’re running from command line, try putting the files in the src folder.<br>Non-functional Specifications:<br>1. Include brief comments in your code identifying yourself, describing the program, and describing key<br>portions of the code.<br>2. Assignments are to be done individually and must be your own work. Software may be used to detect<br>cheating.<br>3. Use Java coding conventions and good programming techniques, for example:<br>i.  Meaningful variable names<br>ii.

Problem statement: formulate the problem.<br>2. Analysis: determine the inputs, outputs, variables, etc<br>3. Design: define the list of steps (the algorithm) needed to solve the problem.<br>4. Implementation: the C code has to be submitted as a separate file. Just indicate here the<br>name of the file.<br>5. Testing: explain how you have tested and verified your C program.<br>EXERCISE 1 (10 POINTS OUT OF 10)<br>Connect 4 is a game of strategy for 2 players. Each player chooses a counter colour and then<br>they take turns to place the counters into a rectangular grid of size M x N (typically 6 x 7).<br>Counters are placed into the top of a column and fall down to occupy the next available slot<br>in that column (see the photo in Figure 1). The game is won when either player is able to<br>create a line of 4 counters vertically, horizontally or diagonally.<br>Figure 1: Connect 4 Game</em><br>This assignment requires you to use a 2 dimensional matrix together with a modular<br>programming strategy to recreate this game using C programming. Your game will allow you<br>to play either against another person, or against the computer who will place counters at<br>random.<br>Program Requirements<br>  Offer the user a choice between playing the computer or another player.<br>  Display the current state of the board to each player<br>  You should use one or more 2 dimensional matrices to represent the Connect 4 playing<br>board declared inside function main() as a local variable and passed to other functions as<br>needed.<br>  As a minimum you should create your own functions to perform the following tasks:<br>1. input counters;<br>2. check the board for a win;<br>3. display the board;<br>Programming Constraints<br>All variables used must be local.<br>Ideas<br>Try to keep your program as flexible as possible e.g. use constants to define matrix sizes so<br>that these could be easily changed.<br>Program in small sections, getting each part to work before integrating them all.<br>Consider how to deal with invalid inputs to avoid crashing the program.<br>Consider providing an option to change the matrix size and the winning length (e.g. connect 5)<br>Don’t forget that this is an interactive game, it should be easy to use and look tidy<br>Note: The programme requirements are becoming more vague (less well defined) with each<br>assignment to allow you the opportunity to interpret the problem in your own way and<br>develop your own solution.<br>What should be submitted?<br>You should submit the followings:<br>1) A short report (up to a few pages of text plus C source codes) detailing for each question:<br>a) SDP steps 1 to 3 in the report (Report + Specification + Analysis + Algorithm Design)<br>(40%)<br>b) SDP step 4 (Implementation(35%) + Robustness(10%)): your C source code including<br>the comments.

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>C语言，实现基本的字符串操作函数和矩阵计算，包括字符串复制，字符串拼接，字符串比对，计算字符串的长度以及统计字符串中字符出现的频率等基本函数。<br>用二维数组表示矩阵，计算矩阵的加法和乘法，涉及使用malloc和free动态分配二维数组的内存，矩阵的计算等知识。<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>CSCE 155E Fall 2016<br>Homework 5<br>Due Date: 11/13/2015, 2.30 PM<br>Instructions Follow instructions carefully, failure to do so may result in points being de-<br>ducted. Make sure your programs compile and run by using the web grader interface. You<br>do not need to printout your source code for the programs. Print a copy of the rubric for<br>this assignment and hand in a hard copy by the due date.<br>Partner policy: You are not allowed to work with a partner for this assignment.<br>Program 1. String Utilities In this exercise you will implement several utility functions<br>involving strings. You will place all of your function prototypes in a header file named<br>string_utils.h and all of your function definitions in a source file, string_utils.c. As before,<br>you should implement your own main test driver program to test your functions, but you<br>need not hand it in.<br>(a) void addChar(char <em>str, char c, int n)<br>- this function should add a char c at index n in string str. The following characters<br>should be shifted up to make room for the inserted character. For example, a call to<br>this function on the string “Hello World”, ‘p’, ‘4’, would result in the string “Hellpo<br>World”<br>(b) int numChar(const char </em>src, char c)<br>- this example determines the number of character c appears in the string. It does<br>not matter if the letter in the string is capitalized or not. For example, a call to this<br>function on the string “HellO World”, ‘o’, would return 2<br>(c) int isPalindrome(const char <em>src)<br>- this example determines if the string src is a palindrome or not. Return 1 if the string<br>is a palindrome and 0 if not. For example, a call to this function on the string “testset”,<br>will return 1<br>(d) int strCompare(const char </em>str, const char <em>str2)<br>- Write your own string comparison function that compares two strings for equality.<br>You cannot use the <string.h> string comparison functions. Make sure the compare<br>function is case insensitive. Return 0 if the two strings are equal and 1 if they are not.<br>For example, a call to this function on the string “Hello world”, and “Hello World” will<br>return 0<br>1<br>(e) char</string.h></em> strCat(char <em>str, char </em>str2)<br>- Concatenate the two strings “str” and “str2” and store that in a newly created dynamic<br>string. The function should return this dynamic string. You cannot use the <string.h><br>concatenation functions. For example, a call to this function on the string “Hello”, and<br>“ World” will return a dynamically created string that contains “Hello World”<br>(f) void consonantVowel(char <em>str)<br>- This function will print out the number of consonantes and vowels in the string. Note:<br>printing should be done in the function (notice the return type is void). For example, a<br>call to this function on the string “Hello”, will print Consonants: 3, Vowels 2<br>Program 2. Array In this exercise you will write several functions that operate on arrays.<br>You will place all the function prototypes in a header file named array_utils.h with their<br>definitions in a source file named array_utils.c. You should test your functions by writing a<br>driver program, but you need not hand it in.<br>(a) The dot product of two arrays are a = [a 1 ,a 2 ,a 3 ,..,a n ] and b = [b 1 ,b 2 ,b 3 ,..,b n ] is<br>a · b =<br>n<br>X<br>i=1<br>a i b i = a 1 b 1 + a 2 b 2 + ··· + a n b n<br>Write a function that computes the dot product of the two arrays<br>int dotProduct(const int </em>a, int size, const int <em>b, int size2);<br>(b) Write a function that takes an integer array and returns the number of integers that<br>are prime in the array<br>int numPrime(const int </em>a, int size);<br>(c) Write the following function:<br>int <em> arrayDifference(const int </em>a, const int <em>b, int sizeOfA, int sizeOfB);<br>which dynamically creates an array and fills it with all integers that can be found in<br>a , but not b . The values in the returned array should be unique; that is, there should<br>not be any duplicates. Furthermore, the size of the allocated arrays should not waste<br>memory.<br>(d) Write the following function:<br>int </em> arrayIntersect(const int <em>a, const int </em>b, int sizeOfA, int sizeOfB);<br>which dynamically creates an array and fills it with all integers that can be found in a<br>and b . The values in the returned array should be unique; that is, there should not be<br>any duplicates. Furthermore, the size of the allocated arrays should not waste memory.<br>Program 3. Matrices In this exercise you will write several functions that operate on<br>matrices or two-dimensional arrays. For this exercise, we will restrict our attention to square<br>matrices-collections of numbers with the same number of columns and rows. You will place<br>2<br>all the function prototypes in a header file named matrix.h with their definitions in a source<br>file named matrix.c. You should test your functions by writing a driver program, but you<br>need not hand it in.<br>(a) Write a function that takes two matrices and determines if the sum of all of the<br>elements in matrix A is equal to the sum of all the elements in matrix B. Return 0 if<br>the summation is equal and 1 if they are not equal.<br>int sumEqual(int <strong>A, int </strong>B, int n);<br>(b) Write a function that takes two matrices and determines if they are equal (all of their<br>elements are the same). If the matrices are equal, return 0. Return 1 if they are not<br>equal.<br>int isEqual(int <strong>A, int </strong>B, int n);<br>(c) Write a function to compute the sum of the elements along the diagonal of the matrix.<br>Return the sum of the elements along the diagonal.<br>int diagonal(int <strong>A, int n);<br>(d) Write a function to compute the summation of matrix A and B.<br>int</strong> sumMatrix(int <strong>A, int </strong>B, int n);<br>(e) The product of two square n × n matrices:<br>C = A × B<br>The entries for C are:<br>c ij =<br>n<br>X<br>k=1<br>a ik b kj<br>where 1 ≤ i,j ≤ n and c ij is the ( i , j )-th entry of the matrix C . Write the following<br>function to compute the product of two n × n square matrices:<br>int <strong> product(int </strong>A, int <em>*B, int n);<br>Bonus<br>Name the files, bonus.c and bonus.h<br>char highestFreq(char </em>str)<br>- this function should return the highest frequency character c in the string. For example, a<br>call to this function with the string “Hello World”, would return “l”,<br>3<br><br><br></string.h></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>C语言练习题，主要知识点是按指定格式解析用户输入的代表数值的字符串，然后对用户输入的字符串进行加减计算，<br>最后将计算结果按照指定的格式输出。主要涉及对字符串的解析，以及二进制，十进制，十六进制数值之间的转换，<br>以及浮点数的二进制表示等知识。<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>CS 211: Computer Architecture, Fall 2016<br>Programming Assignment 2:<br>Data Representation and Computer Arithmetic<br>1 Introduction<br>This assignment is designed to help you learn the representation, interpretation, and manipulation<br>of data as bits. There are two parts. In the first part, you will implement a program calc to add<br>and subtract numbers specified in different bases (multiplication is extra credit). In the second<br>part, you will implement a program format that will print the decimal values of bit sequences<br>representing integer and floating point data types.<br>2 Numeric Base Conversion and Calculator<br>Implement a program called calc with the following usage interface:<br>calc <op> <number1> <number2> <output base=""><br>The first argument, <op>, is either the string “+”, for addition, or “-”, for subtraction. If you<br>want to implement multiplication, then <op> can also be the string “*”. (If you do implement<br>multiplication, make sure to say so in your readme.pdf file so that the TAs know to check your<br>program for this functionality.)<br>The next two arguments, <number1> and <number2> are integers of arbitrary size. Each of these<br>numbers will be given in the form of:<br>−?(b|o|d|x)d n d n−1 …d 1 d 0<br>which can be interpreted as: a number can optionally start with a ’−’ sign, followed by a base<br>indicator, where b means the number is a binary number, o means octal, d means decimal, and x<br>means hexadecimal. d n d n−1 …d 1 d 0 are the digits of the number.<br>The final argument, <output base="">, gives the base that the resulting number should be printed<br>out in. Like the base indicator for the input numbers, this argument can be one of four strings: “b”<br>for binary, “o” for octal, “d” for decimal, and “x” for hexadecimal. Your program should output<br>the answer in the same form as the input numbers (that is, the output number should follow the<br>regular expression given above).<br>Some examples:<br>$ ./calc + d1111111111111111 d1111111111111111 d<br>d2222222222222222<br>1<br>$ ./calc + b1101 b1 d<br>d14<br>$ ./calc + d999999999 d1 d<br>d1000000000<br>$ ./calc - d10 -d4 b<br>b1110<br>$ ./calc + -d10 -d4 b<br>-b1110<br>Note that the numbers in the first example are too large to fit in a 32-bit integer type in C; this is<br>why the arbitrary size is emphasized above. Using a 64-bit integer type is not the solution since the<br>input integers can be arbitrarily large. Rather, you need to design data structures and algorithms<br>that can handle arbitrarily large numbers. Assignment update: any decimal number that we<br>ask you to handle—either an input decimal number or output in decimal format—will<br>fit in a 32-bit integer.<br>Important: You must write the base conversion code yourself. You may not use type-casting,<br>libraries, or output formats in printf(). You may use standard C arithmetic operations. You may<br>use the C standard libraries for functionality not related to the conversion (e.g., string handling<br>functions).<br>Important: If calc detects an error in the inputs, it should print out an error message that starts<br>with the string “ERROR”, followed by a string that gives an informative message about the error<br>that it detected.<br>3 Format Interpretation<br>Implement a program called format with the following usage interface:<br>format <input bit="" sequence=""> <type><br>The first argument, <input bit="" sequence="">, is a sequence of 32 bits. Remember that your C<br>program will get it as a string of 1 and 0 characters in the argv[1] argument to main. This<br>sequence ofbits represents the binary values stored in 4 contiguous bytes in memory. The leftmost<br>bits are stored in the byte with the smallest address while the rightmost bits are stored in the byte<br>with the largest address.<br>The second argument, <type>, gives the type that you should use to interpret the input bit<br>sequence, and can be either int (integer) or float.<br>The formats for the input bit sequence is as follows. If the type is:<br>int: the format is two’s complement;<br>float: the format is IEEE 754 single precision;<br>Note that the input bit sequence can correspond to negative numbers.<br>2<br>Your program should print out the decimal representation of the input bit sequence, assuming a<br>big endian byte ordering. Floating point numbers should be printed in scientific notation, where a<br>number 1.5x10 5 would be printed as 1.5e5. For positive infinity, output pinf, for negative infinity,<br>output ninf, and for “NaN”, output NaN.<br>Here are some examples:<br>$ ./format 01000001010000100100001101000100 int<br>1094861636<br>$ ./format 10000001010000100100001101000100 int<br>-2126363836<br>$ ./format 01000001010000100100001110000100 int<br>1094861700<br>$ ./format 00000000000000000000000000000001 int<br>1<br>$ ./format 01000000110000110100001111010100 float<br>6.10203e0<br>$ ./format 00111010000111111111011000001000 float<br>6.1e-4<br>$ ./format 10000000000000000000000000000000 float<br>-0.0e0<br>$ ./format 01000000010010010000111111011011 float<br>3.141593e0<br>Important: You must write the interpretation code yourself. You may not use type-casting,<br>libraries, or output formats in printf(). You may use standard C arithmetic operations. You may<br>use the C standard libraries for functionality not related to the value interpretation (e.g., string<br>handling functions).<br>Important: If format detects an error in the inputs, it should print out an error message that<br>starts with the string “ERROR”, followed by a string that gives an informative message about the<br>error that it detected. For this program, you can assume that any input bit sequence that is shorter<br>or longer than 32 bits is erroneous.<br>4 Submission<br>You have to e-submit the assignment using Sakai. Your submission should be a tar file named<br>pa2.tar that can be extracted using the command:<br>tar xf pa2.tar<br>3<br>Your tar file must contain:<br>• readme.pdf: this file should describe your design and implementation of the calc program.<br>In particular, it should detail your design, any design/implementation challenges that you<br>ran into, and an analysis (e.g., big-O analysis) of the space and time performance of your<br>program.<br>• makefile: there should be at least the following rules in your makefile:<br>all build both your calc and format executables.<br>calc build your calc executable.<br>format build your format executable.<br>clean remove all object files and executables. Prepare for rebulding from scratch.<br>• source code: All source code and header files necessary for building your calc and format<br>executables. These should at least include calc.c and format.c.<br>You can build your pa2.tgz file in the following steps:<br>1. Put all the files you want to hand in in a subdirectory called pa2.<br>2. In the parent directory that contains pa2, invoke tar:<br>tar cvfz pa2.tgz pa2<br>The arguments to tar are cfvz. The c tells tar to create a new archive file. The f tells tar that the<br>next command line argument is the name of the output file. The z tells tar to compress the tar file<br>with gzip. The v just makes tar list the files it’s putting into the archive.<br>We will compile and test your program on the iLab machines so you should make sure that your<br>program compiles and runs correctly on these machines. You must compile all C code using the<br>gcc compiler with the -Wall flags.<br>5 Grading Guidelines<br>5.1 Functionality<br>This is a large class so that necessarily the most significant part of your grade will be based on<br>programmatic checking of your program. That is, we will build a binary using the Makefile and<br>source code that you submitted, and then test the binary for correct functionality against a set of<br>inputs. Thus:<br>• You should make sure that we can build your program by just running make.<br>• You should test your code as thoroughly as you can. In particular, your code should be adept<br>at handling exceptional cases.<br>Be careful to follow all instructions. If something doesn’t seem right, ask.<br>4<br>5.2 Design<br>Having said the above about functionality, design is a critical part of any programming exercise.<br>In particular, we expect you to write reasonably efficient code based on reasonably performing<br>algorithms and data structures. More importantly, you need to understand the performance (time<br>&amp; space) implications of the algorithms and data structures you chose to use. Thus, the explanation<br>of your design and analyses in the readme.pdf will comprise a non-trivial part of your grade. Give<br>careful thoughts to your writing of this file, rather than writing whatever comes to your mind in the<br>last few minutes before the assignment is due.<br>5.3 Coding Style<br>Finally, it is important that you write “good” code. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to look at<br>your code as closely as we would like to give you good feedback. Nevertheless, a part of your grade<br>will depend on the quality of your code. Here are some guidelines for what we consider to be good:<br>• Your code is modularized. That is, your code is split into pieces that make sense, where the<br>pieces are neither too small nor too big.<br>• Your code is well documented with comments. This does not mean that you should comment<br>every line of code. Common practice is to document each function (the parameters it takes<br>as input, the results produced, any side-effects, and the function’s functionality) and add<br>comments in the code where it will help another programmer figure out what is going on.<br>• You use variable names that have some meaning (rather than cryptic names like i).<br>Further, you should observe the following protocols to make it easier for us to look at your code:<br>• Define prototypes for all functions.<br>• Place all prototype, typedef, and struct definitions in header (.h) files.<br>• Error and warning messages should be printed to stderr using fprintf.<br>5<br><br><br><br></type></type></output></number2></number1></op></op></output></number2></number1></op></font>

It will initialize<br>all array elements to the character ‘O’. ‘O’ symbolizes the seat on the plane is open and can be<br>taken. The int count variable is used to symbolize the number of people who already have a seat<br>on the plane, this is a random number generated and sent from main. In this function it will<br>randomly create and assign an index in the two-dimensional array with the character ‘X’ for each<br>person up to value of count. ‘X’ is used to symbolize that an element in the two dimensional<br>array is occupied. This will be used later on in the program. MAKE SURE TO SEED RAND in<br>MAIN. Below is the way to randomly generate the seats for each passenger to take. This<br>function should be called as soon as your program starts.<br>Keep in mind the possibility of the randomized index overwriting ‘X’, if it was already there.<br>You have to handle that case.

Thus, printing off<br>the characters stored in each index of the two-dimensional array either ‘O’ or ‘X’. As noted<br>above the ROW and COL are #defined in your program, use them. For loops are your friends<br>here. Called in admin mode and during reserving a seat (specifically in seatReservation).<br>4. int loginMatch(int passcode, int adminPasscode);<br>The loginMatch function is called to compare the passcodes, the function returns 1 if both match<br>and 0 if there is no match. This is called in admin mode. Should prompt for the passcode entry<br>until the passcode matches. The adminPasscode is specified, everyone should use the same<br>adminPassocde, then compare that with the passcode user enters in main() when they wish to<br>log-in.<br>5.  int getTotalRevenue(char f1[][COL], char f2[][COL], char f3[ ][COL]);<br>Note: f1, f2, f3 are flight1, flight2, flight3, just shorthanded.<br>The getTotalRevenue function will take in all three two-dimensional character arrays created in<br>main and calculate the total revenue using the costMatrix two dimensional array. With each two-<br>dimensional array f1, f2, and f3, search for the character ‘X’ stored in them, upon finding the<br>index of the character ‘X’, use the index to reference inside of the global two-dimensional array<br>costMatrix (look above in Constants and Global Variables). While inside of costMatrix array,<br>add the value stored in the two-dimensional array with a running total variable (Hint use +=).<br>The function will return the total revenue earned thus far from seats reserved in all 3 flights. So,<br>you will need nested for-loops. This is called only in admin mode.<br>6. void flightMenu();<br>Prints the three flight options as shown. Flights to Miami, Nashville and Las Vegas. This is done<br>when reserve a seat option is chosen.<br>7. void seatReservation(char flight[][COL]);<br>The seatReservation function takes in a two-dimensional array and allows the user to reserve an<br>index on the two-dimensional array. Before any reserving is done, this function calls the<br>printFlightMap function mentioned earlier to allow the user to see the already populated two-<br>dimensional array for that flight. Then, the user is asked to enter a row and column to reserve a<br>seat. Additionally, this function will have built in error checking (look below at output<br>example) Once the user has inputted a correct index within [0, ROW) and [0, COL) in the two-<br>dimensional array, this function needs to check if that index entered is already taken in the two-<br>dimensional array with the character ‘X.’ If the index is populated with ‘X’, an error will be<br>shown to the user (look at the output below) and have them re-enter a new possible row and<br>column again. If the index entered is not filled with ‘X’, then assign that index with ‘X’, i.e.<br>changing the element from ‘O’ to ‘X’. Before the function ends, it will call the function<br>printFlightMap again and prints a success message.<br>Remember, rows run from 0-5 and columns from 0-3. Error check for this too.<br>8. void printMessage(char name[],char num[]);<br>//DO THIS, IF YOU ARE DOING THE BONUS<br>This function is called for each flight option after the seatReservation() is called. It takes in two<br>strings, name of passenger and the flight number for that particular case. Both are character<br>arrays (strings). For flight Cou-&gt;Miami number must be set as “MIA1050”, for Cou-&gt;Nashville<br>number must be set as “BNA1050”, for flight Cou-&gt;Las Vegas num must be set as “LAS1050”,<br>this must be done in main and the name and particular number must be sent to this function.<br>Once in this function, you will merge (important part) the two strings into third string and print<br>that as the e-Ticket as shown below and print a confirmation message.<br>Eg1: name is “Fred” number is “MIA1050”, your merged string should be FMrIeAd1050. Print<br>this as the booking confirmation number.<br>Eg2: name is “Guilliams” number is “LAS1050”, you merged string should be<br>GLuAiSl1l0i5a0ms.<br>Eg3: name is “Christopher” number is “BNA1050”, your merged string should be<br>CBhNrAi1s0t5o0pher<br>9. int main(void)<br>The main function will be doing all (most of) the function calls. In main, you need to create four<br>character arrays of flight_1[ROW][COL], flight_2[ROW][COL], flight_3[ROW][COL], and<br>strings name[MAX],flight_number[MAX]<br>adminPasscode= 105016; // everyone must keep this the same<br>Also, before you call initialSeats function on all the flights arrays individually, make sure to find<br>how many people already reserved seats. This is done by creating a local variable<br>seats = rand % 5 + 1 (this is your int counts in initialSeats function), rand()%5 +1 will give a<br>random number between 1-5; you only need to do this once. A menu system will be displayed for<br>the users to run specific parts of the program (See output below of what the menu system needs<br>to look like). Make sure to implement error checking for invalid input!<br>On the main menu, the user will see a display of options: The options are 1: Admin Portal, 2:<br>Reserve a seat on a flight, and 3: Quit. The menu will need to loop until the exit option is<br>chosen.<br>To access the Admin Portal, the user enters a 1, and then must type a passcode that will be<br>stored in a variable. Now, verify the passcode, call the loginMatch function (you should<br>compare) with passcode and adminPasscode to verify if it is an authentic log-in attempt. If the<br>pair match, that is, they are equivalent then it means successful log-in. Upon successful<br>verification, inside of the admin portal, call printFlightMap on each flight array and<br>getTotalRevenue (See output below). Declare these variables in main().<br>To access Reserve a seat, the user enters a 2. Inside of this portal, the user is displayed the three<br>flights that can be accessed to book a seat. (See below output). As always, verify the user input<br>for flight option (1-5). 2 character arrays will be used, name and flight_number. Once a valid<br>flight option is chosen. Switch to that particular case and ask for the user’s first name and store<br>it in name[] and store the flight numbers (MIA1050,BNA1050,LAS1050) in flight_number[] as<br>specified above for that flight. Then, send the corresponding flight array to seatReservation,<br>after successful reservation the user will be relocated back to the main menu. Then print a<br>success message using name and fligh_number, just to confirm the booking.<br>Must be done for each case (each flight).<br>Then, if you are doing the bonus, call the printMessage with name[] and that particular<br>flight_number[],. Note: flight1 is Miami, flight2 is Nashville, flight3 is Las Vegas.<br>Please go through Sample Output and the document clearly before starting out.<br>Sample Output<br>Character in bold are inputs from the user. Yours will vary but the outline must look similar. It is big,<br>don’t worry, but will help give you a better idea. I have run it twice completely, that’s why it is 10<br>pages.<br><br><br></filename></assignment></class></font>
