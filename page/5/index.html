        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>完成一个库存管理和记录系统，从inventory.txt文件中读取相关数据， 然后包括增删改查等相关功能，属于c语言的基础入门级别的题目<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>ICP Project 15-16<br>1 / 6<br>Introduction to Computer Programming (ICP)<br>CCIT4020, HKU SPACE Community College, 2015-2016 Semester 2<br>Course Project Guidelines: Inventory Management and Record System<br>1)  Introduction<br>Nowadays, an inventory management and record system is important to manage all related<br>inventories in a logistics corporation for shipping and delivery. In this project, a simple and<br>effective inventory management and record system is developed in order to record, search and<br>back up the data of various items in the company. To avoid any conflict between different data<br>types and any other programming bugs, Input data validation processes are necessary to be<br>employed and developed in the system.<br>1.1) File Format for data storage:<br>In this project, one data file “inventory.txt” is required to back up the data. The “inventory.txt”<br>file contains various data for each item (Name of item, Item number, Subject, Weight, Quantity,<br>Recipient, Final destination, and Delivery status). In this project, we assume that the maximum<br>numbers of item records are 50 and the maximum numbers of characters for name of item,<br>recipient, destination and delivery status) are 30.<br>The format and example of data stored in the data file “inventory.txt” are listed as follows:<br>Name of item #1<br>Item number #1<br>Subject #1<br>Weight #1<br>Quantity #1<br>Recipient #1<br>Final Destination #1<br>Delivery Status #1<br>Name of item #2<br>Item number #2<br>Subject #2<br>Weight #2<br>Quantity #2<br>Recipient #2<br>Final Destination #2<br>Delivery Status #2<br>Name of item #3<br>Item number #3<br>Subject #3<br>Weight #3<br>Quantity #3<br>Recipient #3<br>Final Destination #3<br>Delivery Status #3<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>2 / 6<br>The example of items records stored in the data file is listed as follows:<br>Net Wi-Fi Router<br>1001<br>Electronics<br>2.0 kg<br>1<br>Chan Tai Man<br>Kowloon Bay<br>Delivery<br>Fujo Apple Gift Set<br>Food<br>2552<br>1.2kg<br>1<br>Cheung Wai Ming<br>Yuen Long<br>Arrival<br>Koppo Men Jacket<br>Fashion<br>3003<br>0.5kg<br>2<br>Lee Siu Yu<br>Sha Tin<br>Warehouse<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>3 / 6<br>2)  Project Requirements<br>In this project, students are required to form groups in the same class (4 to max. 5 students per<br>group) to develop a C program (Standalone Console-Based Application) for the inventory<br>management and record system. The C program for this system must include two parts: (1) Basic<br>Functions (group part), and (2) Extra Functions (individual part).<br>The example of Basic Functions (group part) of the system is shown as follows:<br>2.1) Requirements for Basic Function (Group Part)<br>The following functions must be supported in the system:<br> Main Menu: in the main() function<br>o  Show menu page when the program is executed or selected option is completed.<br>o  After the main menu is shown, wait for user to input a number (or character) from<br>options above.<br>  Option ‘1’: Add new item record(s)<br>o  Add a new item in the system and store the information of such item in a data file<br>“inventory.txt”.<br>o  Record “Name of item”, “Item number”, “Subject”, “Weight”, “Quantity”, “Recipient”,<br>“Final destination” and “Delivery status”.<br>o  Ask user to add another new item (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu page).<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>4 / 6<br>  Option ‘2’: Display item(s)<br>o  Load and display the items in the system from the corresponding data file<br>“inventory.txt”.<br>o  Display all the item information (Name of item, Item number, Subject, Weight, Quantity,<br>Recipient, Final destination, and Delivery status) line by line on screen.<br>  Option ‘3’: Modify item record(s)<br>o  Update the existing item record and store it to the corresponding data file.<br>o  Ask user to change another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu<br>page).<br>  Option ‘4’: Delete item record(s)<br>o  Delete the existing item record and update the records in the data file.<br>o  Ask user to remove another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu<br>page).<br>  Option ‘5’: Search item information<br>o  Search and display the item information you searched on screen from the corresponding<br>data file “invenotory.txt”.<br>o  Ask user to search another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu<br>page).<br>2.2) Requirements for Extra Function (Individual Part)<br>Each group member is required to develop an extra function (e.g. create a new Option ‘6’ or a new<br>function, etc.) and integrate to the system for this project. These extra functions can be contributed<br>and integrated to the system so as to perform various specific tasks or related purposes. There is no<br>constraint on the function features (except user login with password).<br>Input data<br>Add data for next item<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>5 / 6<br>3)  Submission<br>3.1) Softcopies<br>a) Programming Codes and Files:<br>Softcopies must be submitted to SOUL by a group representative before the deadline.

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>本题主要考试面向对象的类的设计思路，完成一个名字叫21点的纸牌游戏，分别设计了card类，deck类，hand类，player类，dealer类，game类完成各种功能，最后main集成驱动测试<br>额外要求是如果牌面相同的话在比一次，对代码风格也有要求。<br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>Grading: EVERY assignment in this course is graded by demoing your work for<br>10 minutes with a TA. You are required to meet with a TA within two weeks from<br>the due date to demo, and you receive an automatic 50 point deduction for<br>failure to do so. If you miss a scheduled appointment, you will be penalized 10<br>points for rescheduling within 1 day (24 hours), 25 points within 7 days (1 week),<br>and 50 points for anything outside of a week. Your job is to convince the TA that<br>your program works correctly, i.e. show your TA how to use/break your program☺<br>(90 pts) Implementation: Problem Statement<br>You will write a program to play blackjack using C++ classes. Blackjack is a card<br>game that has a dealer and 1 or more players who are trying to get a hand closest to 21<br>without going over. Aces can be 1 or 11, whichever is to your advantage, and all face<br>value cards (Jack, Queen and King) have a value of 10.<br>The players begin with a specific amount of money, and only the players can bet<br>against the dealer. First, everyone decides how much he/she wants to bet. Then,<br>everyone is dealt 2 cards face up, and the dealer gets one face up and one face down.<br>Each player decides whether to receive another card or not without going over 21. If<br>the player goes over 21 (or busts), then he/she immediately loses their bet from their<br>total playing money. After all players finish receiving cards, then the dealer turns over<br>the card that is facing down, and the dealer must receive a new card if the total is below<br>17 and stay/hold if the total is 17 or above.<br> The players with totals over 21 immediately lose their bet from their playing total.<br> If the dealer goes over 21, then the players with 21 and under all win their bet,<br>which is added to their playing total.<br> If the dealer is 21 or under, then the players with card totals less than the dealer<br>lose their bet from their playing total, and those players with card totals greater<br>than the dealer win their bet, which is added to their playing total.<br> Players who have the same card total as the dealer neither win nor lose, their<br>playing total remains unchanged.<br> Players who have a card total of 21, blackjack, win 1.5% their bet to their playing<br>total.<br>You will be required to have the following classes and members. However, you<br>may add more members and functions, based on your design. You will make .cpp<br>files for each class, .h, interface file.

You are required to meet with a TA within one week after<br>the due date to demo. You are penalized for failure to see a TA within the week or<br>missing a scheduled appointment. In either case, if you are within 1 day (24<br>hours) of the deadline, you lose 10 points. If you are within 7 days (1 week) of the<br>deadline, then you lose 25 points, anything outside of a week from the deadline<br>to demo is an automatic 50 point deduction. Your job is to convince the TA that your<br>program works correctly, i.e. show your TA how to use/break your program☺<br>During your time in programming, you will undoubtedly run into a situation where you<br>will need to go through information more than once or need to perform the same task<br>over and over. The way we as programmers accomplish this is through the use of<br>loops and functions.<br>(90 pts) Implementation: Problem Statement<br>You will write a program to compare state and county information. You must<br>have the following structs in your program.<br>struct county {<br>string name; //name of county<br>string <em>city; //name of cities in county<br>int cities; //number of cities in county<br>int population; //total population of county<br>float avg_income; //avg household income<br>float avg_house; //avg household price<br>};<br>struct state {<br>string name; //name of state<br>struct county </em>c; //name of counties<br>int counties; //number of counties in state<br>int population; //total population of state<br>};<br>You will receive the number of states and filename from the user as command-line<br>arguments. The number supplied with the –s option is the number of states to be<br>created and the text following the –f option is the filename with the state/county<br>information: a.out –s 2 –f states1.txt<br>This would create a dynamic array of 2 states on the heap, and you would read the rest<br>of the information about the state and counties from a file. Each line in the file will<br>contain the information for each state and county in the following order:<br>State_name state_pop #_county<br>county_name county_pop county_income county_house #_cities city_name<br>Example:<br>Oregon 1000000 2<br>Benton 53000 100000 250000 1 Corvallis<br>Lane 80000 50000 150000 2 Eugene Springfield<br>South_Carolina 1000000 2<br>Anderson 80000 100000 80000 2 Anderson Pendleton<br>Pickens 50000 50000 20000 2 Clemson Pickens<br>Your program must define the following functions, with the exact prototypes:<br>bool is_valid_arguments(char <em>info[]);<br>state </em> create_states(int);<br>void get_state_data(state <em>);<br>county </em> create_counties(int);<br>void get_county_data(county <em>);<br>void delete_info(state </em>);<br>In addition to these functions above, you need to determine the other functions you will<br>need to print information answering the following information:<br> the state with the largest population,<br> the county with the largest population,<br> the counties with an income above a specific amount, (You must get input from<br>the user for this!!!)<br> the average household cost for all counties in each state,<br> the states in sorted order by name,<br> the states in sorted order by population,<br> the counties within states sorted by population,<br> the counties within states sorted by name.<br>You need to separate your files into interface and implementation and create a Makefile<br>to handle the compilation. Create a state_facts.h, which has the struct type for states<br>and counties, as well as the function declarations for your program. Now, separate your<br>function definitions into a state_facts.cpp file and your main function into a<br>run_facts.cpp file. Now, create a makefile that will create a state_facts executable<br>game and clean your files.<br>Your program must be able to:<br> Print a usage message to the user when too few arguments are supplied or<br>when the options are not –s or -f. You do not need to recover from this, just<br>handle by printing a message.<br> Print an error message and recover, when the user doesn’t supply positive,<br>non-zero integer for the states value.<br> Print an error message and recover, when the player doesn’t supply a valid<br>filename to open.<br> Provide the stats for the states.<br> Continue to ask for new states and new filename. Make sure you do not have<br>a memory leak!!!!!<br>(10 pts) Program Style/Comments<br>In your implementation, make sure that you include a program header in your program,<br>in addition to proper indentation/spacing and other comments!

A generic class is a general version of a class; it<br>is a homogenous data structure that handles multiple data types. MyArray will be similar to C++<br>arrays but will not be constrained to a fixed size. The array size will grow dynamically when the user<br>inserts an element to a full array. The class should not use vectors. Instead, you should use<br>dynamic memory allocation (a dynamic array).<br>The class should use three member variables:<br>-  myarray: the dynamic array<br>-  size: the current size of the array<br>-  used: the number of elements currently used in the array<br>The class should have the following functionalities:<br>? A default constructor that initializes the size of the array to 5.<br>? A default destructor that frees the dynamic memory that was allocated.<br>? int length( ) a method that returns an integer value indicating the number of elements<br>currently used in the array.<br>? void insertHead(Item i) a method that inserts a new item making it the first element in the<br>array. If the array is full, then a new dynamic array of double the size should replace the<br>existing array.<br>? void insertTail(Item i) a method that inserts a new item making it the last element in the<br>array. If the array is full, then a new dynamic array of double the size should replace the<br>existing array.<br>? void deleteHead( ) deletes the first element in the array.<br>? void deleteTail( ) deletes the last element in the array.<br>? void sortAscending( ) sorts the elements of the array in ascending order. Use bubbleSort to<br>do that.<br>? void sortDescending( ) sorts the elements of the array in descending order. Use<br>insertionSort to do that.<br>? C++ allows the overloading of the [ ] operator. This feature makes it possible to access<br>an element in a MyArray object in an array-like behavior. Overload this operator and<br>make sure to have boundary checks using assertions. If the user tries to access an<br>element outside the range of the array or at a location that is not used yet then an error<br>message should be displayed on the screen.<br>For example, the following code:<br>P a g e | 2<br>MyArray<int> a1;<br>cout &lt;&lt; “Number of elements in a1= “ &lt;&lt; a1.length() &lt;&lt; endl;<br>a1.insertTail(35);<br>a1.insertTail(45);<br>a1.insertHead(55);<br>a1.deleteTail();<br>for(int i =0; i &lt; a1.length(); i++)<br>cout &lt;&lt; a1[i] &lt;&lt; endl;<br>Will result in:<br>Number of elements in a1= 0<br>55<br>35<br>If we try any of the two instructions the result should be an assertion error:<br>cout &lt;&lt; a1[4]; //Subscript uninitialized.<br>cout &lt;&lt; a1[14]; //Subscript out of range.<br>Write a main( ) method that provides a menu driven interface that allows the user to test whether<br>each member function of myArray is working properly. The menu should provide the following<br>functionalities:<br>o Create a new array: allows the user to create an array of one of the following types: bool, char,<br>double, float, int, string<br>o Get Length: the current number of elements used in the array<br>o Insert a new element at the head of the array<br>o Insert a new element at the tail of the array<br>o Delete the first element<br>o Delete the last element<br>o Sort the elements in ascending order<br>o Sort the elements in descending order<br>o Print all the elements in the array<br>o Quit the program<br>What to hand in<br>Please submit your C++ source file electronically through Angel.<br><br><br></int></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>c++模拟一个汽车运动模型，文件输入运行轨迹，车辆情况等等。根据一些数学和物理的公式，计算最后的汽车运动情况，同时考虑到c++的类的设计，要求类设计完好。<br>control类，driver类，read类，write类等等功能分离使得思路更加清晰代码明了<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>Usage<br>Usage: catcar controlInputs stateOutputs<br>Requirements Summary<br>Create a C++ program that reads control inputs for a self­driving car from an input file. The program will simulate the car’s<br>state over the time horizon given by the control inputs, and write the results to an output file. The major problem is: the input<br>file was written in such a way that the control inputs are stored out of order!<br>Assignment Name<br>The assignment name for this assignment is: ​catcar<br>1. Kinematic Model Simulation<br>In this project, you will create a program that controls an autonomous vehicle from an input control file. The only problem is<br>that the input controls are jumbled, since a function that operated on the linked list that stored them was badly designed: they<br>were stored in order in a queue, but the queue was designed by a Visual Basic programmer who doesn’t understand memory.<br>They printed the nodes out by order of memory address of the list nodes, instead of by the node order prescribed by the next<br>pointers.<br>So you need to put them back in the right order before proceeding. This program will read in time value at which this<br>command should be executed, then the commanded speed, and tire angle. The duration of the command is the difference<br>between this command’s time value, and the next time value (when the nodes are in order), at a maximum of 201 ms. If there<br>are any durations longer than 201 ms, the input file should be declared invalid, and no simulation should take place.<br>With this sequence of commands, you should save the vehicle’s state at each time step. During the execution of control<br>commands, this program will record the vehicle’s state as it moves (or stands still), and save the output states to a file.<br>2. File Format<br>2.1 controlInputs<br>For this assignment, the input text file will consist of control information, each line contains sample time (in seconds),<br>commanded vehicle velocity (m/s), and tire angle rate (radians/s), with elements separated by whitespace (even the first<br>number could be padded by a whitespace in the front). All values should be stored as doubles.<br>0.06 5 0.523<br>0.02 20 ­0.523<br>0.07 8 0<br>0.00 0 0<br>In this example, at time 0.06 the vehicle should take in as its input command a velocity of 5, with a tire­angle rate of 0.523,<br>for 0.01 seconds. The duration of 0.01 is determined by looking at the next time step (after the vector is confirmed to be<br>sorted), and taking the difference (0.07 ­  0.06).<br>Clearly the above example is an extreme case of driving aggressively. Your program should run regardless of the unlikely<br>control inputs, as long as the below conditions are met:<br>­ The rst element of the sorted list must be at exactly time 0.<br>­ Commanded tire angle rate must be between [?­0.5236, 0.5236] radians/sec (i.e., / 6 radians/sec). ±π<br>­ Commanded velocity must be between [0, 30] m/s;<br>­ Time values must be non­negative; and<br>­ Duration between sorted input objects must be between [5, 201] ms.<br>If any of these are violated for any input value in the file, then the ​controlInputs file is deemed invalid, and an empty<br>output file is written. If at any time a line fails to parse, then the file should be declared invalid. This policy is for safety: you<br>wouldn’t want to start controlling an autonomous car if you accidentally passed in the wrong file, and it started somehow<br>parsing lines!<br>2.2 outputFile<br>This assignment should output a file with information on the state values of the vehicle throughout its journey. The format for<br>this file is one called csv (comma separated values), and is common for inputting data into MATLAB. Each output entry is as<br>follows:<br>t,x1,x2,x3,x4\n<br>Where t is the time at which this state value was measured, and the values in x are given by the kinematic equation (1). The<br>precision for each value should be whatever is the default when using C++ iostream methods.<br>If the control inputs are determined to be invalid, you should create an empty file with the name provided from the command<br>line.<br>3. Vehicle Model<br>You are developing a vehicle simulator, which describes the kinematic motion of a front­steered, two­wheel drive vehicle.<br>The vehicle you are simulating is visually depicted below. The equations of motion for this vehicle are provided in (1).<br>x<br>​<br>1 ​ = ​u<br>​<br>1 ​ cos(​x<br>​<br>3​ ) cos(​x<br>​<br>4​ )<br>(1)<br>x<br>​<br>2 ​ = ​u<br>​<br>1 ​ cos(​x<br>​<br>3​ ) sin(​x<br>​<br>4​ )<br>x<br>​<br>3 ​ = ​u<br>​<br>2<br>x<br>​<br>4 ​ = ​u<br>​<br>1 ​ (1/L) sin(​x<br>​<br>3​ )<br>Where ​x<br>​<br>1 is translational forward motion, ​x<br>​<br>2 is translational left/right motion, x<br>​<br>3 is the tire angle, and ​x<br>​<br>4 is the heading of the<br><br>vehicle. For control inputs, ​u<br>​<br>1 represents vehicle velocity, and ​u<br>​<br>2 represents angular rate of change for the tire angle. The<br><br>wheelbase L is defined in the Vehicle.h header file.<br>Using a simple discretization of these differential equations with a duration ​t<br>​<br>, we can use the following equations for motion:<br>x<br>​<br>1​ (​t<br>​<br>+∆​ t​ )​   ​ = ​x<br>​<br>1​ (​t<br>​<br>) + ∆​ t​  ​u<br>​<br>1​ (​t<br>​<br>)​  ​ cos(​x<br>​<br>3​ (​t<br>​<br>)) cos(​x<br>​<br>4​ (​t<br>​<br>))  (2)<br>x<br>​<br>2 ​ (​t<br>​<br>+∆​ t​ ) = ​x<br>​<br>2 ​ (​t<br>​<br>) +​<br>​<br>∆​ t​  ​u<br>​<br>1​ (​t<br>​<br>)​  ​ cos(​x<br>​<br>3​ (​t<br>​<br>)) sin(​x<br>​<br>4​ (​t<br>​<br>))<br>x<br>​<br>3 ​ (​t<br>​<br>+∆​ t​ )​  ​ = ​x<br>​<br>3 ​ (​t<br>​<br>) + ​<br>​<br>∆​ t ​ u<br>​<br>2​ (​t<br>​<br>)<br>x<br>​<br>4 ​ (​t<br>​<br>+∆​ t​ ) = ​x<br>​<br>4 ​ (​t<br>​<br>) + ​<br>​<br>∆​ t ​ u<br>​<br>1 ​ (​t<br>​<br>) (1/L) sin(​x<br>​<br>3​ (​t<br>​<br>))<br>The value for ​x<br>​<br>3 (tire angle) must always be between [?­0.5236, 0.5236] radians/sec (i.e.,<br>/ 6 radians/sec). If a value is                             ±π<br>commanded outside this range, then ​x<br>​<br>3 should saturate using the above range. Ex: If the tire angle rate is commanded to be<br><br>the value 0.7156, the tire angle rate should equal the maximum value of 0.5236.<br>The heading should always be between [0, 2 ). If the heading is a negative value, the heading should be converted into the               π<br>range [0, 2 ) by repeatedly adding 2  . Ex: If the heading is ­.5 , the heading can be converted to ­0.5 +2  = 1.5 . π π π π π π<br>Defined values are present for these ranges inside of ​State.h<br>4. Class designs<br>The following class definitions must be used for the indicated classes. You may (if you wish) create your own classes to do<br>other tasks. The below classes are prescribed in whole (or in part):<br>Input​, ​State​, ​Vehicle​ (must use exact prescribed class definitions)<br>DataSource​, ​DataSink​, ​Director​ (are at your discretion, except for the sort method prescribed).<br>4.1 Classes that must use prescribed definitions<br>Please use the exact interfaces for Vehicle, State, and Input, or your alpha release may not compile. These are the only classes<br>for which the design is fixed.<br>4.1.1 Input<br>The ​Input class holds the values for the u variables used in the kinematic model. Its interface is included on Piazza as a<br>resource for this Project.<br>4.1.2 State<br>The ​State class is similar to Input, and its interface is included on Piazza as a resource for this Project. However, it does<br>ensure that tire angle values and heading values stay within the designated ranges if the setters for the class are called.<br>4.2 Vehicle<br>The ​Vehicle class executes a control input for the designated duration. The interface is included on Piazza as a resource for<br>this Project.<br>The ​Vehicle keeps its own state, receives a control input, and updates its state. The initial state value for the ​Vehicle is<br>x<br>​<br>1 = 0, x<br>​<br>2<br>​<br>=0, ​x<br>​<br>3 = 0, and ​x<br>​<br>4 = 0, e.g., (0, 0) position, tire angle of 0, and heading of 0. The ​Vehicle class assumes that any<br><br><br>invalid input values have been removed, so it does not do any error checking. The class does not permit anyone to update its<br>state, except by providing an ​Input​ object through the ​stateUpdate​ method prescribed in the header file.<br>4.3 Classes left largely to your design discretion<br>Anything you want to add to the interface for ​DataSource​, ​DataSink​, or ​Director​ is up to you.<br>The ​DataSource class keeps a vector of ​Input objects (control inputs), in order. Likewise, the ​DataSink class keeps a<br>vector of ​State​ objects (state outputs), in order.<br>The ​Director​ is used to pass ​Input​ values along to the ​Vehicle​.<br>Hint<br>​<br>: The ​bool data type is defined in C++, so it won’t work if you try to include the headers from previous projects. Use,<br>instead, the builtin type from C++ for bool functionality.<br>5. Recommended Functional Decomposition<br>In C++, global functions are a sign of a bad design. Rather, you provide methods inside the scope of a class. If you use global<br>functions for this assignment, you will receive significant design deductions. Just like in C programs, your main function<br>should be small. If yours includes lots of logic, rather than depending on the methods of classes, you will receive significant<br>design deductions.<br>5.1 Reading Control Inputs<br>Define a class method (not a global function) that reads all the control inputs from a provided filename. As you read them in,<br>don’t worry about how they’re sorted. The inputs will be stored in a vector in the class. I think you can figure out which class<br>this should be.<br>5.2 Sorting Control Inputs<br>Puts the control inputs in order of their timestamp. The interface for the sort function should be:<br>void​ sort ();       ​// performs qsort<br>If your algorithm does not perform quicksort, you will receive a deduction. Insertion and bubble sort are each unacceptable.<br>You should write your own sort routine, not use the sort routines in STL or any other library. You are, of course, welcome to<br>use other implementations to confirm that your qsort implementation is working, as part of your own tests. The inputs will be<br>already be stored in a vector in the class. I think you can figure out which class this should be.<br>5.2.1 Validating Control Inputs<br>This method should be part of the ​DataSource​ class. The interface for this method should be:<br>// should be called only after the vector is sorted<br>// returns true if the vector in Input objects is valid<br>bool ​validate ();<br>The vector of ​Input​ objects is invalid if any of the criteria from Section 2.1 are discovered.<br>5.3 Writing State Outputs<br>Define a class method (not a global function) that writes a vector of ​Output objects to a file of the provided filename. I<br>think you can figure out which class this should be.<br>5.4 Driving the Car<br>Once you have an (ordered) set of control inputs, you need a ​Director to coordinate the consumption of inputs, and save<br>each output. The ​Director will take the next Input (stored and sorted by the ​DataSource​) to the vehicle, fetch that<br>Output​, and store it in the output vector in the ​DataSink​. When the last ​Input is consumed, a duration of 200 ms should<br>be used. After simulating this ​Input​, the simulation is ended. In order to do this, the ​Director will “contain” a ​Vehicle<br>object, and decide how to interact with it.<br>Part of the assignment is coming up with and writing the pseudocode for this algorithm, in order to stage your design.<br>5.5 What goes in main, then?<br>In your main function, you should instantiate your classes, check your arguments and return the usage statement. Put all the<br>logic and error handling for file I/O, initialization of the ​Vehicle​, etc., in your methods as defined in your other files and in<br>the order that makes sense. You want your main to be very simple, so that if you want to reuse your code, you can do so<br>without a main function.<br>Generally, part of assignments going forward include coming up with and writing the pseudocode for this algorithm, in order<br>that your design can be performed in stages. To bootstrap this process, we provide as an example how to sketch an algorithm<br>is pseudocode below:<br>check usage<br>open input file, and output file<br>execute director<br>  while inputs<br>    execute input(s)<br>    save output(s)<br>write and close output file, input file<br>6. Alpha Submission<br>Your alpha assignment is to implement the Vehicle class methods, and turn in your ​Vehicle.cpp file to the dropbox called<br>Project 3 (alpha) on D2L. We will use your file with our own main function and test files, to check the behavior of each of<br>the ​Vehicle methods we prescribe. Use the same ​vehicle.h ​file given above and provided from the website, or be in<br>danger of your alpha not compiling.<br>As a note, you will have to complete your implementation of ​Input and ​State in order to test your alpha on your own.<br>Submit only your ​Vehicle.cpp ­­ ​do not submit implementations for Input and Output<br>​<br>, we will use our own. We have<br>already included ​Input.h and ​State.h in our ​vehicle.h interface definition, but you may need to include other<br>headers for standard C++ functionality in your cpp file. We do not recommend including headers for other custom classes in<br>your cpp file, since you will not be submitting those headers or their implementation.<br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>自己实现一个类似stl的string库的superstring，对string功能进行扩展，包括自己实现 ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=.等操作符的重载，构造函数，find函数，trim函数，<br>insert，replace，还有类型转换等等函数的实现，难度不大，但是工作量很大。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>SET-252 C Programming #2<br>Homework:    SuperString – Final Project ( 30% of your final grade )<br><br><br>Warning:    You fail the course if you fail the final project.<br>Warning:    Your final grade for the course cannot be higher than your final project grade.<br>Warning:    You cannot consult with any student that has already completed this project.<br>Warning:    You cannot view, use or reference any code for this project written by students that have taken this course in the past.<br><br>Step 1<br>Implement the following class header file (i.e. write the cpp file).<br>You may add any other properties and/or methods that you need.  You might want to check with me before adding them just to make sure you’re on the right track.<br>Write a main function that will test all the different methods.  Make sure your main function is easy to read and understand.  I recommend you use regions and procedures to break up the logic.  You can easily comment out a call to previously made procedures so you can test only the current procedure that you are working on.<br>You may use any string functions you want (e.g. strlen, strstr, etc).<br>You may not use the built-in String class.<br>In addition to the methods listed below, overload the following operators with all reasonable parameters (i.e. char, const char <em>, CSuperString &amp;): ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=.<br>NONE of the class methods other than the constructors or the assignment operators ( = and += ) should change m_pstrSuperString.<br>You must assign the value back to the class instance to make it permanent.  For example:<br>ssBuffer = ssBuffer.ToUpperCase( );<br>Minus one letter grade for any memory leak.  Minus two letter grades if there are a lot of memory leaks.<br>Minus one letter grade if replace with substrings doesn’t work correctly.<br>Minus one letter grade if self assignment doesn’t work correctly (e.g. ssBuffer = ssBuffer.ToUpperCase( ); ).<br>Minus one letter grade if you don’t solve the double call problem.  The following should display correctly:<br>printf( “Left( 2 ): %s, Left( 4 ): %s\n”, ssBuffer.Left( 2 ), ssBuffer.Left( 4 ) );<br>Splitting the code up into two lines is not the solution.<br>Add the following procedure to your tests and make sure it executes without errors.<br><br>void MuahahahTest1( )<br>{<br>CSuperString ssTest;<br>cout &lt;&lt; “Muahahah Test #1: “ &lt;&lt; ssTest &lt;&lt; endl;<br>    }<br><br>Add the following procedure to your tests and make sure it executes without errors.<br><br>void MuahahahTest2( )<br>{<br>CSuperString ssTest = “I Love Star Wars and I Love Star Trek”;<br><br>ssTest = ssTest.Replace( “Love”,”Really Love Love” );<br><br>cout &lt;&lt; “Muahahah Test #2: “ &lt;&lt; ssTest &lt;&lt; endl;<br>    }<br>I recommend you start with just the following methods, get those working and code, test and run additional methods one at a time: constructor, initialize, assignment operator, deep copy, to string and print.<br>Next, I’d recommend you get all the other constructors done.<br>After that, I’d recommend you get all the “to <data type="">” methods done.<br><br>// ——————————————————————————–<br>// Class: CSuperString<br>// ——————————————————————————–<br>class CSuperString<br>{<br><br>    private:<br>        char</data></em> m_pstrSuperString;<br><br>    public:<br>        // Constructors<br>        CSuperString( );<br>        // Parameterized/Copy constructors<br>        // CSuperString ssBuffer( “I Love Star Trek” );<br>        // CSuperString ssBuffer( 3.14159f );<br>        CSuperString( const char <em>pstrStringToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const bool blnBooleanToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const char chrLetterToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const short shtShortToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const int intIntegerToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const long lngLongToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const float sngFloatToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const double dblDoubleToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const CSuperString &amp;ssStringToCopy );<br><br>        // Destructor<br>        virtual ~CSuperString( );<br><br>        long Length( ) const;<br><br>        // Assignment Operators<br>        void operator = ( const char </em>pstrStringToCopy );<br>        void operator = ( const char chrLetterToCopy );<br>        void operator = ( const CSuperString &amp;ssStringToCopy );<br>        // Extra credit for numeric parameters<br><br>        // Concatenate operator<br>        void operator += ( const char <em>pstrStringToAppend );<br>        void operator += ( const char chrCharacterToAppend );<br>        void operator += ( const CSuperString &amp;ssStringToAppend );<br>        // Extra credit for numeric parameters<br><br>        friend CSuperString operator + ( const CSuperString &amp;ssLeft,<br>                                const CSuperString &amp;ssRight );<br>        friend CSuperString operator + ( const char </em> pstrLeftSide,<br>                                const CSuperString &amp;ssRightString );<br>        friend CSuperString operator + ( const CSuperString &amp;ssLeftString,<br>                                const char <em> pstrRightSide );<br><br>        long FindFirstIndexOf ( const char chrLetterToFind );<br>        long FindFirstIndexOf ( const char chrLetterToFind, long lngStartIndex );<br>        long FindLastIndexOf ( const char chrLetterToFind );<br><br>        long FindFirstIndexOf ( const char </em>pstrSubStringToFind );<br>        long FindFirstIndexOf ( const char <em>pstrSubStringToFind, long lngStartIndex );<br>        long FindLastIndexOf ( const char </em>pstrSubStringToFind );<br><br>        // Do not change original string.

For this lab you will NOT be creating any classes of your own. In fact you can do the whole lab in the main, although I think that you will see that it is highly advisable to have at least one non-member function since there is a task that is repeated.<br>Begin by copying the file names.txt to your working directory. This file has a long list of first names, all taken from some of my classes. Briefly open it and look at it, or just skim through it with more names.txt<br><br>At the top of your program #includeas well as iostream, string, and fstream. Declare a multiset that is capable of holding strings.<br>Fill the multiset with all the names in the file. (Since there are no spaces in the names you can use &gt;&gt; or getline.)<br>Now declare an iterator that is appropriate for traversing the multiset. Set it to the beginning of the multiset full of names, and walk through the list, outputting each name it finds. (There are a lot of them, so you may want to separate them with spaces instead of putting one on each line.)<br>Run and test this program. Your name should be somewhere in the list. (Note that the names are now in alphabetical order.)<br>Here is the place where you want to pass your STL container to a non-member function, since we are doing something that is basically the same three times in a row. If you do you should pass the container by const and reference, since it is large. You will probably want one additional parameter.<br><br>Declare two iterators.<br>Move one of them through the list to the first name that begins with ‘M’. Since you know it is returning a string, you will know that (it).at(0) will return the first character in that string.<br>Now set the second iterator equal to the first. Use it to count how many M names there are in the list. Print this number out.<br>Using the second iterator, print out all the M names in reverse alphabetical order. (Remember that these are bidirectional iterators, so you –it works to go backwards.)<br>Now do the above three steps for all the ‘C’ names and then for all the ‘Q’ names.<br>If I had asked for ‘Y’ (I didn’t) the output would look like:<br>There are 3 Y names in the list<br>They are:Yujia Yuanhang Yingjie<br>This program has no user interaction. When you have it working, simply start a script file, run the program once, and close the script file.<br>Submit your source code and the script file to Blackboard.<br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>这次需要代写的Java编程作业，考察Graph的知识点，读文件构造Graph，然后按条件用BFS搜索，并最终输出结果。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>n this project, you write a program that will help you play the “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon” game. This game is played on a graph of movies and actors/actresses who starred in them. The Bacon Number is defined as follows: Kevin Bacon has a Bacon Number of 0; people who co-starred in a movie with Kevin Bacon have a Bacon Number of 1; people who co-starred in a movie with someone who has a Bacon Number of 1 in turn have a Bacon Number of 2; and so on. Given any actor/actress, the goal of the game is to establish their Bacon Number by a sequence of movies and co-stars. As shown in Figure 1, Bill Murray has a Kevin Bacon number of 1, because co-starred in “Wild Things”, while Cameron Diaz has a Kevin Bacon Number of 2, because she she co-starred with Bill Murray in “Charlie’s Angels”.<br>For example, using the “action” data set given below, we can show that “Al Pacino” has a Bacon Number<br>of 3 as follows:<br><br>Pacino, Al<br>   Heat (1995)<br>Rosales Jr., Thomas<br>   Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997)<br>Richards, Ariana<br>   Tremors (1990)<br>Bacon, Kevin<br>Kevin Bacon (0) starred in Tremors with Richards, Ariana (1) who starred in Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997) with Rosales Jr., Thomas (2) who starred in Heat (1995) with Pacino, Al (3). If we use the “all cast” data set given below, we can show that “Al Pacino” has a Bacon Number of 1 as follows:<br><br>Pacino, Al<br>   Boffo! Tinseltown’s Bombs and Blockbusters (2006)<br>Bacon, Kevin<br>Kevin Bacon (0) starred in Boffo! Tinseltown’s Bombs and Blockbusters (2006) with Pacino, Al (1). Inter- estingly this works way in the past as well:<br><br>De Rosselli, Rex<br>   Lion’s Claws, The (1918)<br>Brinley, Charles<br>   Adventure in Sahara (1938)<br>Lawrence, Marc (I)<br>   Big Easy, The (1987)<br>Goodman, John (I)<br>   Death Sentence (2007)<br>Bacon, Kevin<br>Turns out that Rex De Rosselli died in 1941 and yet he has a Bacon Number of just 4. Actually Rex really has a Bacon Number of 3 but we need to use a much bigger data set “cast.all.txt” to show this:<br><br>De Rosselli, Rex<br>   Dangerous Adventure, A (1922)<br>McCullough, Philo<br>   Chamber of Horrors (1966)<br>Danova, Cesare<br>   Animal House (1978)<br>Bacon, Kevin<br>We have included two data sets suitable for the program in the archive above (the data sets are courtesy of Robert Sedgewick):<br><br>action06.txt (4.4 MB, only action movies)<br>cast.all.txt (64 MB, all movies from the 2014 IMDB)<br>The format of these data sets is rather simple: Each line is a movie, and each movie consists of several fields separated by the “/“ character. The first field is the name of the movie itself, all the following fields are the names of actors and actresses starring in the movie. For example:<br><br>Heat (1995)/Daniels, Max/Perry, Manny/Marzan, Rick/Pacino, Al, …<br>Heat After Dark (1996)/Kitami, Toshiyuki/Sugata,…<br>Heated Vengeance (1985)/Dye, Cameron/Walker, Robert (III), …<br>Reading this data is not complicated, but we hand you the parsing code anyway so you can focus on the search algorithm instead.<br>In order to find the smallest Bacon Number for an actor we proceed as follows: First we identify the vertices for both Kevin Bacon and the actor in question (you already have that code). Then we start a breadth-first search at the vertex for Kevin Bacon; as we do this we keep track of the “previous vertex” that got us to the one we’re currently investigating. Once we find the vertex for the other actor, we are done: We just have to print out the path that got us here. This implementation of BFS is the only thing you have to write for this problem!<br>You will implement following functions in the given project:<br><br>1.Degree of separation from Kevin Bacon:<br>2.Degree of separation between any two actors/actresses:<br>3.Search actor/actress/movie:<br>4.List cast of a movie or movies of an actor/actress:<br>5.Exit<br>Select:<br>Here is what each menu item does:<br><br>Finds the Kevin Bacon number of an actor/actress<br>Find the shortest distance between any two actors/actresses.<br>Actors with same name has a Roman number after their names. You can enter the name and search the exact name in the database. For example, Emma Watson’s name appeared as “Watson, Emma (II)” in the movie database.<br>If input is a movies, it lists all the case. If the input is an actor/actress, it lists all the movies he/she<br>starred in.<br>terminate the program.<br>The “Graph” class, “Bag” class are fully implemented for you. The Graph class represents an undirected graph of vertices named 0 through V - 1. It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the graph, iterate over all of the vertices adjacent to a vertex. It also provides methods for returning the number of vertices V and the number of edges E. Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted. This implementation uses an adjacency-lists representation, which is a vertex-indexed array of Bag objects. All operations take constant time (in the worst case) except iterating over the vertices adjacent to a given vertex, which takes time proportional to the number of such vertices.<br>You will have add the mapping relationships between vertex symbols (name of a movie, actor, acres) and vertex number in “SymbolGraph” class. For example: in Graph 2, vertex 0 and vertex 5 can represent movies and other vertices represent actors/actresses. You also have to implement to methods to find the shortest path between two given vertices. All edges have the weight of 1. Therefore, you can also use BFS to find the shortest distance between two vertices.<br>Before you are sure your program is running correctly, test your code with a smaller database base. Start with a file that only has 5-10 movies and actors/actresses. If you think your program is working, then try with “action06.txt”, (4.4 MB, only action movies). To try “cast.all.txt”, 64 MB, all movies from the 2014 IMDB, 300,000 movies, 900,000 actors/actresses, you have to allocate larger memory for your project. Google it for instructions to do that. If you run your program from coo and line you specify memory size in your command line. Following command allocate 2gb memory for JVM to run KevinBacon.<br><br></font>
