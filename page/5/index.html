The goal is<br>to build a hand of cards that values as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. First,<br>here is the terminology used in the game.<br> Hit: Take another card for your hand<br> Stand: Stop taking cards<br> Bust: Exceed a value of 21 in your hand<br> Push: Tie with the dealer<br>The cards are valued as follows.<br>Rank Value<br>Ace 11 or 1<br>2–10 Face value<br>Jack, Queen, King 10<br>Of particular note, an Ace can be considered either value 11 or 1. Given rational strategy,<br>it will be considered 11 unless that will cause a bust, in which case it will be considered 1.<br>In each hand, play proceeds as follows.<br>1. The dealer takes one card, which the player can see.<br>2. The player is given two cards.<br>3. The player has the option to hit, or take one additional card. The player can hit as<br>many times as desired, until they reach or exceed 21, or decide to stand (stop taking<br>cards).<br>1<br>4. If the player did not bust (exceed 21), the dealer takes cards until she reaches 17 or<br>higher (i.e., the dealer will hit on 16 or fewer points, and stand on 17 or more points).<br>5. If the player busts, she immediately loses, and the dealer will not draw more cards.<br>If the dealer busts, the player wins. If the player and dealer have the same total, it is<br>a push. Otherwise, the winner is the one with higher point total.<br>6. If the player loses, she loses her bet. If the player wins, she wins her bet. If the hand<br>is a push, the bet is returned (i.e., no gain or loss).<br>In this project, you will program a functional Blackjack game by first coding the basic logic<br>of the game, then gradually adding features.<br>2<br>Lab Session 1, Feb 24–Feb 25<br>Activity 1<br>In this activity, you will code the logic of the game using simplifications, rather than tackling<br>a full Blackjack game all at once. Instead of selecting a card and then determining its value,<br>you will instead randomly generate a card’s value from between 2 and 11. You will also<br>assume that the bet is always $25.<br>Note that randomly generating a card’s value is not an accurate way to simulate draws. In a<br>real deck, there are more cards worth 10 than there are, e.g., cards worth 5. Consider other<br>ways in which this version of Blackjack will not be exactly the same as real-life Blackjack.<br>You will add features to make the game more realistic in later activities.<br>1. Write a main() function that asks the user for their name, and initializes their starting<br>money to $1,000.<br>2. Write a loop in main() that will play a hand of blackjack, then ask the user if they want<br>to play another hand (as long as they still have money to bet). You will play a hand<br>by calling the play_hand(name) function (which does not yet exist). This function<br>should return the change in the player’s money (positive if they win, negative if they<br>lose), and you should use this value to update their amount after each hand.<br>3. Write the play_hand(name) function. In this function, you will need to track the<br>running total of the cards that the dealer and player have been dealt. Deal one card<br>to the dealer and two to the player. Prompt the player for their action (hit/stay)<br>until they reach or exceed 21, or choose to stay. Then, deal cards to the dealer until<br>they reach or exceed 17. Determine the winner, and return the change in the player’s<br>money (i.e., 25 if they won, -25 if they lost, and 0 if the hand was a push).<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Dealer received card of value 2<br>Bill received card of value 9<br>Bill received card of value 5<br>Dealer total: 2<br>Bill total: 14<br>Move?

(y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>5<br>Activity 2<br>In this activity, you will improve the drawing of cards. You will use the strategy we’ve<br>learned in lecture for encoding information in a way that the computer can store it: trans-<br>form the information into a number. In this activity, use an integer to store each card, and<br>represent them as follows.<br>Rank int encoding Point value<br>Ace (A) 1 11<br>2 2 2<br>3 3 3<br>4 4 4<br>5 5 5<br>6 6 6<br>7 7 7<br>8 8 8<br>9 9 9<br>10 10 10<br>Jack (J) 11 10<br>Queen (Q) 12 10<br>King (K) 13 10<br>Now, you can randomly generate a card from Ace to King, rather than randomly generating<br>a value. You will modify your program so that you can determine how to display each card,<br>as well as what value it has.<br>1. Write a function value_of_card(card) that takes as a parameter an int-encoded<br>card as described above (i.e., an int value from 1 to 13) and returns its point value as<br>described above.<br>2. Write a function string_of_card(card) that takes as a parameter an int-encoded<br>card as described above and returns the card’s string value for printing during the<br>game.<br>For example, string_of_card(5) should return “5”, and string_of_card(12) (a<br>Queen) should return “Q”.<br>3. Modify the play_hand function to generate a random card, rather than a random card<br>value. When adding a card to the player or dealer’s total, use value_of_card(card),<br>and when displaying a card, use string_of_card(card).<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>6<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Dealer received 2<br>Bill received A<br>Bill received K<br>Dealer total: 2<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer received A<br>Dealer total: 13<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer received 9<br>Dealer total: 22<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer bust<br>Bill has $1,025<br>Play again? (y/n) y<br>Dealer received K<br>Bill received 6<br>Bill received Q<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 16<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received 6<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 22<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>7<br>Lab Session 2, Mar 2–Mar 3<br>Activity 3<br>In this activity, you will save the player’s game and allow them to resume. You will use file<br>I/O as discussed in lecture. You will save and restore the player’s name and money total.<br>1. Write a function save(name, money) that saves the user’s name and money to the<br>file blackjack.save.<br>Hint: In order to restore this information successfully, you should save these two<br>pieces of information on separate lines of the file.<br>2. Write a function restore() that attempts to read the user’s name and money from<br>the file blackjack.save. If it is successful, it should return these values as a string and<br>an int, respectively. If it fails, it should return ‘’, -1 to indicate it was unsuccessful.<br>3. Modify function main() to call save(name, money) before quitting.<br>4. Modify function main() to call restore() when starting up. If the load was successful,<br>ask the user if they would like to resume or start a new game. If it was unsuccessful,<br>simply start a new game.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage (nothing has changed yet, because there<br>is no saved game to load):<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Dealer received K<br>Bill received Q<br>Bill received 3<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 13<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received 4<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 17<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received A<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 28<br>Bill bust<br>8<br>Bill has $975<br>Play again? (y/n) y<br>Dealer received Q<br>Bill received J<br>Bill received 6<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 16<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received J<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 26<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $950<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Here is an example of the load functionality when running the program again:<br>Resume saved game ‘Bill’? (y/n) y<br>Bill has $950<br>Dealer received K<br>Bill received 7<br>Bill received Q<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 17<br>Move? (hit/stay) s<br>Dealer received K<br>Dealer total: 20<br>Bill total: 17<br>Dealer wins<br>Bill has $925<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Finally, here is an example of starting a new game even though a saved game exists:<br>9<br>Resume saved game ‘Bill’? (y/n) n<br>Name? Phil<br>Phil has $1,000<br>Dealer received 4<br>Phil received 3<br>Phil received J<br>Dealer total: 4<br>Phil total: 13<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Phil received 10<br>Dealer total: 4<br>Phil total: 23<br>Phil bust<br>Phil has $975<br>Play again? (y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>10<br>Activity 4<br>In this activity, you will allow the player to change their bet before each hand.<br>1. Write a function input_bet(bet, money) that accepts parameter for the current bet<br>and amount of money available, and returns the bet input from the user. Perform<br>input validation on the following requirements:<br>The bet must be a whole number, cannot be negative, and cannot be greater than the<br>available money. If the user presses enter without typing anything, use the existing<br>bet value (if valid). The user can bet 0, which means they want to quit the game.<br>2. Modify main() to call input_bet(bet, money) before every hand instead of prompt-<br>ing for y/n for another hand. If the user bets 0, save their game and quit.<br>Now, you will need to pass the current bet to the play_hand function, and modify<br>this function so it returns the correct change in the player’s money when they win or<br>lose.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 1500<br>Cannot bet more than $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) Fifty<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 500<br>Dealer received J<br>Bill received 10<br>Bill received 10<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 20<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received Q<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 30<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $500<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $500)<br>Dealer received A<br>Bill received 5<br>Bill received K<br>11<br>Dealer total: 11<br>Bill total: 15<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received A<br>Dealer total: 11<br>Bill total: 26<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $0<br>Game over<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>12<br>Lab Session 3, Mar 16–Mar 17<br>Activity 5<br>In this activity, you will improve the card drawing functionality even further. In real life,<br>you cannot draw 5 Aces in a single hand. However, if we’re only generating random cards,<br>this is possible. Therefore, for each hand, you will create a deck of cards, shuffle it, and<br>draw from it.<br>1. Write a function new_deck() that returns a list containing 4 Kings, 4 Queens, etc.<br>using the integer encoding from Activity 2.<br>Hint: Use nested loops.<br>2. Write a function shuffle_deck(deck) that returns a shuffled version of the deck.<br>Hint: Use the random module.<br>3. Modify play_hand() so that it creates and shuffles a deck at the start of each hand.<br>Instead of randomly generating cards, “draw” them from the shuffled deck. Be sure<br>that you do not draw the same card from the deck multiple times (e.g., by removing<br>the card you draw from the deck).<br>Unless you know how to count cards, the output after this activity will not look very<br>different. However, your distribution of cards will be more realistic. You should run your<br>program to ensure that you are still getting random-looking cards, and not drawing the<br>same cards over and over again.<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>13<br>Activity 6<br>In this activity, you will modify your encoding of cards so that it stores both the rank (A–K)<br>and the suit (♣, ♦, ♥, ♠).<br>1. Modify new_deck() so that it creates a list of cards where each card is a tuple of size<br>2. Store the int value first, then a string value representing the suit.<br>Hint: You may be able to copy and paste the suit symbols directly into your text<br>editor. If not, you can use the following escape sequences to include the suit symbols<br>in a string literal in Python.<br>Suit Escape sequence<br>♣ \u2663<br>♦ \u2662<br>♥ \u2661<br>♠ \u2660<br>2. Modify value_of_card to account for the change in encoding of cards.<br>3. Modify the string_of_card to print both the rank and suit of the card.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 100<br>Dealer received 10♦<br>Bill received 6♦<br>Bill received 2♠<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 8<br>Move? (hit/stay) h<br>Bill received A♠<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 19<br>Move? (hit/stay) s<br>Dealer received A♣<br>Dealer total: 21<br>Bill total: 19<br>Dealer wins<br>14<br>Bill has $900<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $100) 0<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>15<br>Lab Session 4, Mar 23–Mar 24<br>Activity 7<br>In this activity, you will modify your program to improve its output. Instead of keeping<br>track of only the total points of the player and dealer, you will keep track of their full hand<br>as a list of cards.<br>1. Write function string_of_hand(hand) that uses the string_of_card(card) func-<br>tion to return a string of an entire hand (encoded as a list of cards).<br>2. Write function value_of_hand(hand) that uses the value_of_card(card) function<br>to return the value of an entire hand of cards.<br>3. Modify the function play_hand so that it keeps track of the hands of the player and<br>dealer, rather than just the total points for their hand. Then modify your output so<br>that it prints the hands instead of individual cards.<br>4. Modify your function value_of_hand(hand) so that it correctly adds the value of<br>Ace.<br>Recall the rule: if an Ace of value 11 would make the hand bust, it is considered to<br>be value 1 instead. Thus, an Ace alone is worth 11, an Ace and a King is worth 21,<br>and two Aces is worth 12.<br>Hint: It may help to create a list of values for each card. For example, if the user<br>has two Aces, first create the list of values [11, 11], then modify it according to the<br>rule.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 100<br>Bet: $100<br>Dealer’s hand: 10♥<br>Value: 10<br>Bill’s hand: J♠ 2♣<br>Value: 12<br>Move?

Links will be provided on the eLP for<br>electronic submission of your work.<br>Marking and feedback will be available within the following 3 weeks in class<br>or via an appointment, or via e-mail.<br>Weighting towards Module 70%<br>Learning Objectives Covered The following learning objectives are either<br>fully or partially covered by this assignment:<br>1. Analyse and specify a programming problem.<br>2. Design a high-level solution to the problem using object oriented and<br>general imperative programming language constructs.<br>3. Write, compile, execute, test and debug an OO program, which maps the<br>high-level design onto concrete programming constructs, using appropriate<br>documentation standards and software tools.<br>4. Critically evaluate the methodologies and conceptual tools used in devel-<br>oping solutions to programming problems.<br>The two main themes of this assignment are programming graphical user inter-<br>faces in Java and using inheritence in Java.<br>The work is set in week 9 of the module by which time you will have covered<br>the key concepts required to complete the work. However, you may find that<br>some of the material discussed after the Easter Vacation may be of use in your<br>implementation of the program.<br>1<br>Problem Specification<br>You are going to provide a version of the loans recording system (assignment 1)<br>with a GUI and some extra functionality.<br>The system needs to be expanded to include items for sale as well as items for<br>loan. The system should hold a price and a number in stock for a sale-item,<br>and a borrower and a return-date for a loan item. Thus there will be two types<br>of Item in the collection.<br>1. LoanItem: consisting of item ID and item description plus a borrower and<br>a return date; the ID consists of the letters LN followed by a three-digit<br>number;<br>2. SaleItem: consisting of item ID and description plus a price and a number<br>in stock; the ID consists of the letters SL followed by a three-digit number;<br>You are provided with two classes as a starting point for the work:<br>• Item a class representing a single item entry in the system. This class<br>contains only the ID and description; you will need to extend it to include<br>the extra data (borrower name and loan date (a long integer) in case of<br>LoanItem and description and quantity in case of SaleItem).<br>• ItemCollection a class representing the collection of item records, and<br>containing functions to save the item data (in text format) to a data file,<br>and to load item data from the file.<br>There is also a sample data file, containing IDs and descriptions only, and a<br>Main.class which illustrates loading from the data file into the item collection,<br>and saving of the item collection to the data file. More on these classes below.<br>Requirements<br>The following are essential functional requirements of the program:<br>1. The system needs to be expanded to include items for sale as well as items<br>for loan, as above.<br>• The Item class needs to be extended to classes LoanItem (record-<br>ing borrower and return data as per assignment 1) and SaleItem,<br>recording price and number in stock in addition to ID, description.<br>• The ItemCollection class needs to be extended also.<br>The ExtendedItemCollection class will inherit the ArrayList<item><br>and use this to store the two types of Item in one list, but will need<br>extra methods to support the functions set out below.<br>2<br>In particular, the Items in the collection will be a mixture of LoanItems<br>and SaleItems; your code needs to be able to distinguish these.<br>2. Your program should provide the following functions -<br>(a) issue a loan-item on loan;<br>(b) check back in a loan-item;<br>(c) sell some quantity of a sale-item (and update of the number in stock);<br>(d) list all entries;<br>(e) list all loan-item entries;<br>(f) list all loan-items currently on loan;<br>(g) list all sale-item entries;<br>3. The user interface must be a GUI.<br>Figure 1: A GUI for the application<br>General Points<br>1. You must make use of inheritance in developing this program. This should<br>involve you in extending the given Item and ItemCollection classes. Al-<br>3<br>though you may be given the source files, your program you MUST NOT<br>make any changes to these files.<br>2. All interactions must be via a GUI. Typically you can expect to make use<br>of buttons, text areas, and text fields. Your GUI should look something<br>like that depicted in figure 1.<br>3. The program should consist of a number of classes each with well defined<br>functionality. There should be a driver class to set things going; a GUI<br>class to provide the user interface; classes concerned with the address<br>book.<br>4. Your program should deal with error conditions by producing an error<br>dialogue window when the use makes a mistake (Consider the use of JOp-<br>tionPane dialogues for the error dialogues. This will require a little inves-<br>tigation on your part.)<br>5. Input could be via the ‘generic’ dialogues provided by JOptionPane; or<br>you could try making your own custom dialogues extending JDialog class.<br>6. All classes must be fully documented using Javadoc conventions.<br>7. The code you produce must adhere to the published course coding stan-<br>dards. Failure to adhere to the standards will lead to a loss of marks.<br>8. You will be expected to test your program against a suitable set of sit-<br>uations. In the documentation you should describe your testing strategy<br>(see below).<br>Design<br>You must produce design documentation. This will include a class diagram for<br>the system, a short explanation as to the general purpose of each of the classes<br>you have produced and their key methods; and a justification for any design<br>decisions you have made.<br>Implementation<br>You must provide listings for your program. The code must adhere to the Java<br>style standards as defined for the module.<br>Testing<br>You are expected to test your code. During the module we looked at strategies<br>for testing programs. You must apply these strategies to your work.<br>4<br>The testing section of your documentation indicates the approach you have<br>taken to verifying and validating your system. Just as you should not convey<br>the design of your system by presenting the code or even listing the classes,<br>you should not merely list the tests performed. Rather, discuss how tests were<br>selected, why they are sufficient, why a reader should believe that no important<br>tests were omitted, and why the reader should believe that the system will really<br>operate as desired when in use.<br>1. Strategy: An explanation of the overall strategy for testing: Black box<br>and/or white box, integration, kinds of test beds or test drivers used,<br>sources of test data, test suites. You might want to use different techniques<br>(or combinations of techniques) in different parts of the program. In each<br>case, justify your decisions.<br>2. Test Data: A set of tables showing the test data you used for each class,<br>etc. The format of the test documentation should be as follows: for each<br>test case in the tables,<br>• a unique ID<br>• a brief description of the purpose of the test<br>• the pre-conditions for running the test<br>• the test data<br>• the expected result<br>Reflection<br>You must provide a final critical evaluation of your work.<br>The reflection section is where you can generalize from specific failures or suc-<br>cesses to rules that you or others can use in future software development. What<br>surprised you most? What do you wish you knew when you started? How could<br>you have avoided problems that you encountered during development?<br>1. Evaluation: What you regard as the successes and failures of the devel-<br>opment: unresolved design problems, performance problems, etc. Identify<br>which features of your design are the important ones. Point out design<br>or implementation techniques that you are particularly proud of. Dis-<br>cuss what mistakes you made in your design, and the problems that they<br>caused.<br>2. Lessons: What lessons you learned from the experience: how you might<br>do it differently a second time round, and how the faults of the design and<br>implementation may be corrected. Describe factors that caused problems<br>such as missed milestones or to the known bugs and limitations.<br>5<br>3. Known Bugs and Limitations: In what ways does your implementation<br>fall short of the specification? Be precise. Although you will lose points<br>for bugs and missing features, you will receive partial credit for accurately<br>identifying those errors, and the source of the problem.<br>This should be 1 to 2 pages long.<br>Deliverables<br>You are expected to submit the following items:<br>1. Your working Java classes, source code and project files (if approriate).<br>JUnit test classes and sources should be included. Your Java source code<br>should<br>(a) be fully commented in the JavaDoc style;<br>(b) adhere to the defined coding standards.<br>2. a .jar file containing your application classes.<br>3. The HTML documentation produced by JavaDoc.<br>4. A report containing the following sections:<br>(a) A cover page giving your name, University ID, and module details;<br>(b) Design documentation as outlined above;<br>(c) All the test documentation outlned above;<br>(d) Your reflection and critical evaluation, as outlined above<br>(e) Brief instructions on running your program (this will not be marked);<br>Submission is electronic. Electronic Copies of your work should be sub-<br>mitted via the assignment mechanism on the eLP (Blackboard). Separate links<br>will be provided for (1) a ZIP containing your java source, classes, etc, your<br>jar file and your Javadoc-generted documentation; and (2) your report, in PDF<br>format.<br>Academic integrity<br>You must adhere to the university regulations on academic conduct. Formal<br>inquiry proceedings will be instigated if there is any suspicion of plagiarism or<br>any other form of misconduct in your work. Refer to the Universitys Assessment<br>Regulations for Northumbria Awards if you are unclear as to the meaning of<br>these terms. The latest copy is available on the University website.<br>6<br>Classes Provided<br>Your have been given the following .class files from which you will build your<br>new system:<br>• Entry.class<br>• AddressBook.class<br>The documentation for each class is also provided but you should not count on<br>seeing the source code. It is intended that you use the functionality provided<br>by these classes without modifying them in any way.<br>To use these classes<br>1. In BlueJ create the project for the assignment<br>2. Copy the .class files into the folder created for this project. They might<br>NOT appear immediately inside BlueJ although later on you may see<br>them.<br>3. Now start to add your own classes.<br>Assessment<br>Feedback will be provided at the end of the semester, about 3 weeks after<br>submission, by inerview or by e-mail.<br>The marking for the assignment is designed to reflect the general guidance given<br>on the University’s web site for the assessment of postgraduate work. Some<br>modifications to the generic criteria have been made to better reflect the nature<br>of the assignment. The marking scheme is set out below.<br>70-100 Distinction Excellent work providing evidence to a very high level of the<br>knowledge, understanding and skills appropriate to level 7. All learning<br>outcomes met, many at high level. Marks at the high end of this range<br>indicate outstanding work where all learning outcomes are met at a high<br>level.

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>java的网络编程，主要是一个FileSender 发送类和一个FileReceiver接收类， 考察了网络编程的基础知识，CRC32 Checksum验证，<br>消息头的封装和解封，数据的传输等等知识<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>Page 1 of 6<br>Assignment 2<br>Introduction<br>In this assignment, you will transfer a file over UDP protocol on top of an unreliable channel<br>that may either corrupt or drop packets randomly (but always deliver packets in order).<br>Writing Your Programs<br>You are free to write your programs on any platform/IDE that you are familiar with.<br>Grading<br>Your programs will be graded according to their correctness using a grading script:<br>• [2 points] Programs are compilable on sunfire, program execution follows specified<br>Java commands (see sections below).<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver when channel is<br>perfectly reliable (i.e. no error at all).<br>Page 2 of 6<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>data packet corruption.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>ACK/NAK packet corruption.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>data packet loss.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>ACK/NAK packet loss.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence<br>of both packet corruption and packet loss.<br>To conclude a successful file transfer, received file must have identical content as the<br>sent one (use command cmp to check it on sunfire). Your program should work for<br>both text and binary files, and for both small files and large files (a few MBs).<br>Grading script doesn’t care what messages your programs print on the screen. It just checks<br>if the received file is exactly the same as the sent one in respective test cases.<br>• [2 points] (Who runs faster?) Time taken for your programs to transfer an enormous file<br>(more than 10MB) in the presence of both packet corruption and packet loss will be noted<br>down. The fastest batch of student programs will receive 2 marks and slower programs that<br>are still faster than average will receive 1 mark. J<br>You may apply the knowledge gained from this or other courses as appropriate. However,<br>since the objective of this assignment is to design a fast network transmission protocol,<br>you are NOT allowed to play tricks (e.g., data compression) to gain unfair advantage<br>over your peers. Please consult the teaching team if you are unsure if certain techniques<br>can be used or not.<br>A Word of Advice<br>This assignment is complex and time-consuming. You are suggested to write programs<br>incrementally and modularly. For example, deal with data packet corruption first, then ACK<br>packet corruption, then data packet loss, etc. Test your programs after every single major<br>change. Take note that partial credit will be awarded even if your programs don’t meet all listed<br>requirements.<br>Page 3 of 6<br>Overall Architecture<br>There are three programs in this assignment, FileSender, UnreliNET and<br>FileReceiver. Their relationship is illustrated in Figure 1 below. The FileSender and<br>FileReceiver programs implement a file transfer application over UDP protocol. The<br>UnreliNET program simulates the transmission channel that transmits packets unreliably and<br>randomly corrupts or loses packets. However, for simplicity, you can assume that this channel<br>always delivers packets in order.<br>Figure 1: UnreliNet Simulates Unreliable Network<br>The UnreliNET program acts as a proxy between FileSender and FileReceiver.<br>Instead of sending packets directly to FileReceiver, FileSender sends all packets to<br>UnreliNET. UnreliNET may introduce bit errors to packets or lose packets randomly. It<br>then forwards packets (if not lost) to FileReceiver. When receiving feedback packets from<br>FileReceiver, UnreliNET may also corrupt them or lose them with certain probability<br>before relaying them to FileSender.<br>The UnreliNET program is complete and given. Your task in this assignment is to develop the<br>FileSender and FileReceiver programs so that a file can be successfully transferred<br>from sender to receiver in the presence of possible packet corruption and packet loss. The<br>received file should be identical to the file sent. You may need to implement techniques learnt<br>in lecture, including sequence number, acknowledgement, timeout and retransmission, to<br>ensure that packets are correctly delivered.<br>FileSender Class<br>The FileSender program is basically a file uploader that opens a given file and sends its<br>content as a sequence of packets to UnreliNet. UnreliNet would then corrupt/lose<br>packets with certain probability before relaying them to the FileReceiver program.<br>To run FileSender on sunfire, type command:<br>java  FileSender  <path filename=""></path>  <unrelinetip><br><unrelinetport> <rcvfilename><br>For example:<br>java FileSender ../test/cny.mp3 localhost 9000 gxfc.mp3<br>sends the file cny.mp3 from directory (relative path) ../test to UnreliNet running in<br>the same host at port 9000. UnreliNet will then pass the file to your FileReceiver<br>program to be stored as gxfc.mp3.<br>UnreliNET  FileSender  FileReceiver<br>Page 4 of 6<br>(Note: Windows system uses a different file separator ‘\’, e.g., ..\test\cny.mp3)<br>You may assume that during testing, your sender program will be supplied with the correct<br>path and filename (no more than 100 bytes long). No input validation is needed.<br>UnreliNET Class<br>The UnreliNET program simulates an unreliable channel that may corrupt or lose packets<br>with a certain probability. This program is given and shouldn’t be changed.<br>To run UnreliNET on sunfire, type command:<br>java  UnreliNET  <p_data_corrupt>  <p_ack_corrupt><br><p_data_loss> <p_ack_loss> <unrelinetport> <rcvhostname><br><rcvport><br>For example:<br>java UnreliNET 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.05 9000 localhost 9001<br>listens on port 9000 and forwards all received data packets to FileReceiver running on the<br>same host at port 9001, with 30% chance of packet corruption and 10% chance of packet loss.<br>The UnreliNET program also forwards ACK/NAK packets to FileSender, with 20% packet<br>corruption rate and 5% packet loss rate.<br>Packet Corruption Probability<br>The UnreliNET program randomly corrupts or loses data packets and ACK/NAK packets<br>according to the specified parameters P_DATA_CORRUPT, P_ACK_CORRUPT P_ACK_LOSS and<br>P_ACK_LOSS. You can set these values to anything in the range [0, 0.3] during testing (setting a<br>too large corruption/loss rate may result in a very slow file transmission).<br>If you have trouble getting your code to work, it might be advisable to set them to 0 first for<br>debugging purposes.<br>FileReceiver Class<br>The FileReceiver program receives a file from FileSender (through UnreliNET) and<br>saves it in the same directory as the FileReceiver program, with a filename specified by<br>FileSender.<br>To run FileReceiver on sunfire, type command:<br>java FileReceiver <rcvport><br>For example:<br>java FileReceiver 9001<br>listens on port 9001 and dumps the bytes received into a file whose name is given by sender.<br>Page 5 of 6<br>Running All Three Programs<br>You should first launch FileReceiver, followed by UnreliNET in the second window.<br>Finally, launch FileSender in a third window to start data transmission. All programs should<br>receive user input from command-line argument only. Please always test your programs in<br>localhost to avoid the interference of network traffic on your programs.<br>The UnreliNET program simulates unreliable communication network and runs infinitely.<br>Once launched, you may reuse it in consecutive tests. To manually terminate it, press <ctrl> + c.<br>The UnreliNET program prints out information that is helpful in debugging your programs.<br>However, we will disable such outputs in speed test.<br>The sender and receiver programs shouldn’t communicate with each other directly – all traffic<br>should be forwarded by the UnreliNET program. The sender program should terminate<br>properly (e.g., no exception, no infinite loop) once transmission finishes.

In C program please.<br>The Bare Minimum<br>The minimum requirement is for a central server that can accept two connections.<br>Either client can then type a message, which is then sent to the server. The server<br>relays the message to the other client. A sample run of the program might look like the<br>following:<br>&gt; ./chat 127.0.0.1<br>What is your screen name? &gt;&gt; KitC<br>KitC has joined the chat.<br>Linda has joined the chat.<br>&gt;&gt; Hi, Linda. Are we having our meeting later today?<br>[Your Message Has Been Sent]<br>Linda: No. I’m really busy writing our paper and<br>a couple other people have conflicts.<br>&gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks!<br>[Your Message Has Been Sent]<br>&gt;&gt; exit<br>KitC has left the chat.<br>This is only an example interface, but shows the minimum requirements of sending<br>messages between the clients. A confirmation that your message has been sent by the<br>client is also a requirement at this level.<br>Level 2 Requirements<br>In Level 2, a few more features may be added. In the example above, there were<br>notifications when a user entered or left the chat. Level 2 code should add this feature.<br>At this level, the server should be able to accept multiple connections | not just two.<br>That means that the server needs to keep track of who sent a message and distribute<br>it to all of the other clients except the one who sent it.<br>Buffet Features<br>If you have time or interest, you can add any or all of the following features.<br>Private messages between clients (Something like @replies in Twitter)<br>Sending a message to a subset of clients<br>Add some pretty formatting to the messages (like colors, line wrapping, etc.)<br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>unix的IPC通讯，涉及到消息队列，共享内存等等多进程知识，是操作系统的必须课程<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>In this assignment you are to develop a chat program between two users, similar to the<br>one already available on the UNIX system called talk. When two instances of your<br>program are being run simultaneously on the system, a user typing in one instance will be<br>able to send the message typed to the user running the other instance of the program.<br>User interface can be a very simple one by using printf() and scanf() functions of the C<br>programming language. IPC mechanism is going to be developed using Message Queues.<br>Important: You should design your code so that when the user is waiting to type a<br>message, at the same time messages are being retrieved from the queue if they arrive in it.<br>This requires multi-threaded program.<br>Specifics<br>IPC Introduction and naming<br>Under UNIX operating system, apart from pipes and signals as primitive type of IPC,<br>from System V release new techniques were added: message queues, semaphores and<br>shared memory. You can investigate the status of IPC facilities on the system by entering<br>ipcs –b on the command prompt. IPC Message queues will exist even after the process<br>creating it terminates, thus it should be manually removed with the ipcrm –q <id><br>command, since IPC resources on a system are limited.<br>IPC system calls related to the Message Queues that is the mechanism of choice for the<br>IPC are: msgget for allocating an IPC or gaining access to an existing queue. msgctl to<br>control an IPC, modify its status and/or remove it. Lastly, for sending and receiving<br>messages msgsnd and msgrcv are used.<br>Once an IPC facility is created using the msgget function, an IPC identifier is returned by<br>the system. The user creating the IPC facility identified by the returned identifier should<br>specify the access permissions. Header <sys ipc.h=""> defines the IPC permissions structure<br>called: ipc_perm. Also, <sys types.h=""> needs to be included in every program before the<br>sys/ipc.h is included.<br>The unique system-wide identifier identifies message queues. To create such an identifier<br>of type key_t defined in the <sys ipc.h=""> file, ftok() function should be used. If ftok() is<br>called with the same arguments from two different processes, the same key would be<br>produced, thus two different processes would be able to access the same IPC facility.<br>For example:<br>key_t key;<br>key = ftok(“.”, 123);<br>First argument is the reference to an existing accessible file (in UNIX, file “.” – a<br>reference to the current directory is always available and accessible). Second argument is<br>some integer, referred to as an id. There are also constants to be passed as an ID: for<br>example IPC_PRIVATE that assures that returned key is always unique.<br>Creating Message Queue<br>A message queue is created using the msgget system call. If successful, a non-negative<br>integer is returned which is a message queue identifier that can be used in subsequent<br>calls that reference it. First parameter is the key returned by ftok(), and the second<br>parameter is the access permission that is of the same format as the chmod command<br>parameter. Passing 0777 would give read and write permissions to everyone on the<br>system. To verify proper access permissions are made, once the queue is created, you can<br>observe set permissions with the ipcs –b command described at the beginning of this<br>section. Furthermore, use the IPC_CREAT flag ORed with the 0777 to assure that the<br>queue is created if it does not exist or if it already exist, an identifier to it is simply<br>returned.<br>For example:<br>mq_handle = msgget(key, IPC_CREAT | 0777);<br>if(mq_handle&lt;=-1) {<br>printf(“Error creating message queue\n”);<br>perror(“MQ Sample”); /<em> print the error </em>/<br>return(1);<br>}<br>Obtaining information about the message queue<br>Using the msgctl function and the IPC_STAT flag passed to it, information about the<br>queue, its owner, number of bytes on the queue, number of messages, etc…can be<br>obtained. An include file <sys msg.h=""> needs also to be included in the program.<br>For example:<br>struct msqid_ds *info;<br>int ret;<br>…<br>ret = msgctl(mq_handle, IPC_STAT, info);<br>if(ret==-1) {<br>printf(“Failed to obtain message queue information\n”);<br>perror(“MQ Sample”);exit(1); }<br>printf(“# of messages on queue: %d\n”, info-&gt;msg_qnum);<br>Communicating through Message Queue<br>A message is defined in the struct msgbuf in the include file <sys msg.h="">. First field of<br>the structure, mtype, is an user-defined positive integer id, agreed between the programs<br>using the message queue to selectively retrieve the messages from it. Suppose, 4<br>programs (instances of the chat program) are using the same message queue, in that case<br>the following should be done to assure proper bi-directional communication:<br>Instance 1  Instance 2  Instance 3  Instance 4<br>Instance 1  –  12  13  14<br>Instance 2  21  –  23  24<br>Instance 3  31  32  –  34<br>Instance 4  41  42  43  –<br>For example:<br>Instance 1 will use mtype=12 to send a message to the Instance 2 and also Instance 1 will<br>retrieve messages that have mtype=21. Instance 2 will use mtype=12 to retrieve messages<br>from the queue from the Instance 1 and it will use mtype=21 to send a message to the<br>Instance 1. Thus, we assure that there is a bi-directional communication on the same<br>channel (same message queue) that is shared by many instances of the same chat program<br>and messages are not delivered to the wrong instance.<br>msgsend()<br>msgsend() takes four parameters and it returns 0 on success and –1 on failure setting the<br>errno global variable to a pre-specified number that can be examined to retrieve the error<br>(or by using perror() function to get a meaningful message).<br>First parameter is the identifier of the message queue. Second parameter is the pointer to<br>the actual message. Third parameter is the size of the message obtained by using the<br>sizeof operator, and the last parameter is the flags. IPC_NOWAIT is one flag, which<br>causes a non-blocking send (send would block if the queue was full) or a zero can be<br>passed if no flags are needed).<br>msgrcv()<br>msgrcv() takes five parameters. First one is the queue identifier. Second one is the pointer<br>to where the received message will be placed (receiver’s end structure should have the<br>first member as ulong to assure message type can be correctly written). Third one is the<br>maximum size of the message that can be received. Fourth parameter specifies which<br>messages should be received: an identifier used in mtype at the sender’s side or 0 to<br>retrieve all messages. Fifth parameter is the flags. IPC_NOWAIT is to create a no-<br>blocking receive and MSG_NOERROR is not to produce any error if the message<br>received is bigger than the maximum size specified. If MSG_NOERROR is not specified<br>and message received is larger than the maximum specified size an error will occur.<br>msgrcv() returns –1 on failure or number of bytes received if it is successful. On error, it<br>also sets errno global variable able to be retrieved using perror().<br>Submission<br>You should submit your C program on Carmen along with details on how to run it and<br>anything else that would allow the grader to grade your work.<br><br><br></sys></sys></sys></sys></sys></id></font>

In this project, a simple and<br>effective inventory management and record system is developed in order to record, search and<br>back up the data of various items in the company. To avoid any conflict between different data<br>types and any other programming bugs, Input data validation processes are necessary to be<br>employed and developed in the system.<br>1.1) File Format for data storage:<br>In this project, one data file “inventory.txt” is required to back up the data. The “inventory.txt”<br>file contains various data for each item (Name of item, Item number, Subject, Weight, Quantity,<br>Recipient, Final destination, and Delivery status). In this project, we assume that the maximum<br>numbers of item records are 50 and the maximum numbers of characters for name of item,<br>recipient, destination and delivery status) are 30.<br>The format and example of data stored in the data file “inventory.txt” are listed as follows:<br>Name of item #1<br>Item number #1<br>Subject #1<br>Weight #1<br>Quantity #1<br>Recipient #1<br>Final Destination #1<br>Delivery Status #1<br>Name of item #2<br>Item number #2<br>Subject #2<br>Weight #2<br>Quantity #2<br>Recipient #2<br>Final Destination #2<br>Delivery Status #2<br>Name of item #3<br>Item number #3<br>Subject #3<br>Weight #3<br>Quantity #3<br>Recipient #3<br>Final Destination #3<br>Delivery Status #3<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>2 / 6<br>The example of items records stored in the data file is listed as follows:<br>Net Wi-Fi Router<br>1001<br>Electronics<br>2.0 kg<br>1<br>Chan Tai Man<br>Kowloon Bay<br>Delivery<br>Fujo Apple Gift Set<br>Food<br>2552<br>1.2kg<br>1<br>Cheung Wai Ming<br>Yuen Long<br>Arrival<br>Koppo Men Jacket<br>Fashion<br>3003<br>0.5kg<br>2<br>Lee Siu Yu<br>Sha Tin<br>Warehouse<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>3 / 6<br>2)  Project Requirements<br>In this project, students are required to form groups in the same class (4 to max. 5 students per<br>group) to develop a C program (Standalone Console-Based Application) for the inventory<br>management and record system. The C program for this system must include two parts: (1) Basic<br>Functions (group part), and (2) Extra Functions (individual part).<br>The example of Basic Functions (group part) of the system is shown as follows:<br>2.1) Requirements for Basic Function (Group Part)<br>The following functions must be supported in the system:<br> Main Menu: in the main() function<br>o  Show menu page when the program is executed or selected option is completed.<br>o  After the main menu is shown, wait for user to input a number (or character) from<br>options above.<br>  Option ‘1’: Add new item record(s)<br>o  Add a new item in the system and store the information of such item in a data file<br>“inventory.txt”.<br>o  Record “Name of item”, “Item number”, “Subject”, “Weight”, “Quantity”, “Recipient”,<br>“Final destination” and “Delivery status”.<br>o  Ask user to add another new item (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu page).<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>4 / 6<br>  Option ‘2’: Display item(s)<br>o  Load and display the items in the system from the corresponding data file<br>“inventory.txt”.<br>o  Display all the item information (Name of item, Item number, Subject, Weight, Quantity,<br>Recipient, Final destination, and Delivery status) line by line on screen.<br>  Option ‘3’: Modify item record(s)<br>o  Update the existing item record and store it to the corresponding data file.<br>o  Ask user to change another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu<br>page).<br>  Option ‘4’: Delete item record(s)<br>o  Delete the existing item record and update the records in the data file.<br>o  Ask user to remove another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu<br>page).<br>  Option ‘5’: Search item information<br>o  Search and display the item information you searched on screen from the corresponding<br>data file “invenotory.txt”.<br>o  Ask user to search another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu<br>page).<br>2.2) Requirements for Extra Function (Individual Part)<br>Each group member is required to develop an extra function (e.g. create a new Option ‘6’ or a new<br>function, etc.) and integrate to the system for this project. These extra functions can be contributed<br>and integrated to the system so as to perform various specific tasks or related purposes. There is no<br>constraint on the function features (except user login with password).<br>Input data<br>Add data for next item<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>5 / 6<br>3)  Submission<br>3.1) Softcopies<br>a) Programming Codes and Files:<br>Softcopies must be submitted to SOUL by a group representative before the deadline.

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>本题主要考试面向对象的类的设计思路，完成一个名字叫21点的纸牌游戏，分别设计了card类，deck类，hand类，player类，dealer类，game类完成各种功能，最后main集成驱动测试<br>额外要求是如果牌面相同的话在比一次，对代码风格也有要求。<br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>Grading: EVERY assignment in this course is graded by demoing your work for<br>10 minutes with a TA. You are required to meet with a TA within two weeks from<br>the due date to demo, and you receive an automatic 50 point deduction for<br>failure to do so. If you miss a scheduled appointment, you will be penalized 10<br>points for rescheduling within 1 day (24 hours), 25 points within 7 days (1 week),<br>and 50 points for anything outside of a week. Your job is to convince the TA that<br>your program works correctly, i.e. show your TA how to use/break your program☺<br>(90 pts) Implementation: Problem Statement<br>You will write a program to play blackjack using C++ classes. Blackjack is a card<br>game that has a dealer and 1 or more players who are trying to get a hand closest to 21<br>without going over. Aces can be 1 or 11, whichever is to your advantage, and all face<br>value cards (Jack, Queen and King) have a value of 10.<br>The players begin with a specific amount of money, and only the players can bet<br>against the dealer. First, everyone decides how much he/she wants to bet. Then,<br>everyone is dealt 2 cards face up, and the dealer gets one face up and one face down.<br>Each player decides whether to receive another card or not without going over 21. If<br>the player goes over 21 (or busts), then he/she immediately loses their bet from their<br>total playing money. After all players finish receiving cards, then the dealer turns over<br>the card that is facing down, and the dealer must receive a new card if the total is below<br>17 and stay/hold if the total is 17 or above.<br> The players with totals over 21 immediately lose their bet from their playing total.<br> If the dealer goes over 21, then the players with 21 and under all win their bet,<br>which is added to their playing total.<br> If the dealer is 21 or under, then the players with card totals less than the dealer<br>lose their bet from their playing total, and those players with card totals greater<br>than the dealer win their bet, which is added to their playing total.<br> Players who have the same card total as the dealer neither win nor lose, their<br>playing total remains unchanged.<br> Players who have a card total of 21, blackjack, win 1.5% their bet to their playing<br>total.<br>You will be required to have the following classes and members. However, you<br>may add more members and functions, based on your design. You will make .cpp<br>files for each class, .h, interface file. Make sure you include the correct .h files<br>with the .cpp files.<br>//card.h interface file<br>class card {<br>private:<br>int value; //1-13<br>char <em>suit; //4 each: club, spade, heart, diamond<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>//deck.h interface file<br>class deck {<br>private:<br>card cards[52];<br>int num_cards;<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>//hand.h interface file<br>class hand {<br>private:<br>card </em>cards;<br>int num_cards;<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>//player.h interface file<br>class player {<br>private:<br>hand p_hand;<br>int playing_total;<br>int card_total;<br>int bet;<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>//dealer.h interface file<br>class dealer {<br>private:<br>hand d_hand;<br>int card_total;<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>//game.h interface file<br>class game {<br>private:<br>deck cards;<br>player <em>players;<br>dealer game_dealer;<br>int num_players;<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>Your program must be able to:<br> Setup a deck of 52 cards with spades, clubs, diamonds, and hearts of 2-10, Jack,<br>Queen, King, and Ace for each suit.<br> Shuffle the deck of cards before playing any game.<br> Determine how many players and the playing total for each.<br> Make sure that a player’s bet is less than or equal to the playing total.<br> Determine when a full deck has been dealt, and reshuffle.<br> You should not have any memory leaks in your program.<br>Extra Credit (10 pts):<br>In blackjack, if a player starts with doubles (cards with the same value), then the cards<br>can be split into different hands. The player is given two cards, one for each hand, and<br>the dealer now gets two cards for a different hand. After the first hand is played, then<br>the second hand is played between the dealer and the player who split.<br>(10 pts) Program Style/Comments<br>In your implementation, make sure that you include a program header in your program,<br>in addition to proper indentation/spacing and other comments! Below is an example<br>header to include. Make sure you review the style guidelines for this class, and begin<br>trying to follow them, i.e. don’t align everything on the left or put everything on one line!<br><a href="http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/spring2016/cs162-001/162_style_guideline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/spring2016/cs162-001/162_style_guideline.pdf</a><br>/<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>**</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><br><strong> Program: play_game.cpp
