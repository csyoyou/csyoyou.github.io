Problem statement: formulate the problem.<br>2. Analysis: determine the inputs, outputs, variables, etc<br>3. Design: define the list of steps (the algorithm) needed to solve the problem.<br>4. Implementation: the C code has to be submitted as a separate file. Just indicate here the<br>name of the file.<br>5. Testing: explain how you have tested and verified your C program.<br>EXERCISE 1 (10 POINTS OUT OF 10)<br>Connect 4 is a game of strategy for 2 players. Each player chooses a counter colour and then<br>they take turns to place the counters into a rectangular grid of size M x N (typically 6 x 7).<br>Counters are placed into the top of a column and fall down to occupy the next available slot<br>in that column (see the photo in Figure 1). The game is won when either player is able to<br>create a line of 4 counters vertically, horizontally or diagonally.<br>Figure 1: Connect 4 Game</em><br>This assignment requires you to use a 2 dimensional matrix together with a modular<br>programming strategy to recreate this game using C programming.

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>C语言，实现基本的字符串操作函数和矩阵计算，包括字符串复制，字符串拼接，字符串比对，计算字符串的长度以及统计字符串中字符出现的频率等基本函数。<br>用二维数组表示矩阵，计算矩阵的加法和乘法，涉及使用malloc和free动态分配二维数组的内存，矩阵的计算等知识。<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>CSCE 155E Fall 2016<br>Homework 5<br>Due Date: 11/13/2015, 2.30 PM<br>Instructions Follow instructions carefully, failure to do so may result in points being de-<br>ducted. Make sure your programs compile and run by using the web grader interface. You<br>do not need to printout your source code for the programs. Print a copy of the rubric for<br>this assignment and hand in a hard copy by the due date.<br>Partner policy: You are not allowed to work with a partner for this assignment.<br>Program 1. String Utilities In this exercise you will implement several utility functions<br>involving strings. You will place all of your function prototypes in a header file named<br>string_utils.h and all of your function definitions in a source file, string_utils.c. As before,<br>you should implement your own main test driver program to test your functions, but you<br>need not hand it in.<br>(a) void addChar(char <em>str, char c, int n)<br>- this function should add a char c at index n in string str. The following characters<br>should be shifted up to make room for the inserted character. For example, a call to<br>this function on the string “Hello World”, ‘p’, ‘4’, would result in the string “Hellpo<br>World”<br>(b) int numChar(const char </em>src, char c)<br>- this example determines the number of character c appears in the string. It does<br>not matter if the letter in the string is capitalized or not. For example, a call to this<br>function on the string “HellO World”, ‘o’, would return 2<br>(c) int isPalindrome(const char <em>src)<br>- this example determines if the string src is a palindrome or not. Return 1 if the string<br>is a palindrome and 0 if not. For example, a call to this function on the string “testset”,<br>will return 1<br>(d) int strCompare(const char </em>str, const char <em>str2)<br>- Write your own string comparison function that compares two strings for equality.<br>You cannot use the <string.h> string comparison functions. Make sure the compare<br>function is case insensitive. Return 0 if the two strings are equal and 1 if they are not.<br>For example, a call to this function on the string “Hello world”, and “Hello World” will<br>return 0<br>1<br>(e) char</string.h></em> strCat(char <em>str, char </em>str2)<br>- Concatenate the two strings “str” and “str2” and store that in a newly created dynamic<br>string. The function should return this dynamic string. You cannot use the <string.h><br>concatenation functions. For example, a call to this function on the string “Hello”, and<br>“ World” will return a dynamically created string that contains “Hello World”<br>(f) void consonantVowel(char <em>str)<br>- This function will print out the number of consonantes and vowels in the string. Note:<br>printing should be done in the function (notice the return type is void). For example, a<br>call to this function on the string “Hello”, will print Consonants: 3, Vowels 2<br>Program 2. Array In this exercise you will write several functions that operate on arrays.<br>You will place all the function prototypes in a header file named array_utils.h with their<br>definitions in a source file named array_utils.c. You should test your functions by writing a<br>driver program, but you need not hand it in.<br>(a) The dot product of two arrays are a = [a 1 ,a 2 ,a 3 ,..,a n ] and b = [b 1 ,b 2 ,b 3 ,..,b n ] is<br>a · b =<br>n<br>X<br>i=1<br>a i b i = a 1 b 1 + a 2 b 2 + ··· + a n b n<br>Write a function that computes the dot product of the two arrays<br>int dotProduct(const int </em>a, int size, const int <em>b, int size2);<br>(b) Write a function that takes an integer array and returns the number of integers that<br>are prime in the array<br>int numPrime(const int </em>a, int size);<br>(c) Write the following function:<br>int <em> arrayDifference(const int </em>a, const int <em>b, int sizeOfA, int sizeOfB);<br>which dynamically creates an array and fills it with all integers that can be found in<br>a , but not b . The values in the returned array should be unique; that is, there should<br>not be any duplicates. Furthermore, the size of the allocated arrays should not waste<br>memory.<br>(d) Write the following function:<br>int </em> arrayIntersect(const int <em>a, const int </em>b, int sizeOfA, int sizeOfB);<br>which dynamically creates an array and fills it with all integers that can be found in a<br>and b . The values in the returned array should be unique; that is, there should not be<br>any duplicates. Furthermore, the size of the allocated arrays should not waste memory.<br>Program 3. Matrices In this exercise you will write several functions that operate on<br>matrices or two-dimensional arrays. For this exercise, we will restrict our attention to square<br>matrices-collections of numbers with the same number of columns and rows. You will place<br>2<br>all the function prototypes in a header file named matrix.h with their definitions in a source<br>file named matrix.c. You should test your functions by writing a driver program, but you<br>need not hand it in.<br>(a) Write a function that takes two matrices and determines if the sum of all of the<br>elements in matrix A is equal to the sum of all the elements in matrix B. Return 0 if<br>the summation is equal and 1 if they are not equal.<br>int sumEqual(int <strong>A, int </strong>B, int n);<br>(b) Write a function that takes two matrices and determines if they are equal (all of their<br>elements are the same). If the matrices are equal, return 0. Return 1 if they are not<br>equal.<br>int isEqual(int <strong>A, int </strong>B, int n);<br>(c) Write a function to compute the sum of the elements along the diagonal of the matrix.<br>Return the sum of the elements along the diagonal.<br>int diagonal(int <strong>A, int n);<br>(d) Write a function to compute the summation of matrix A and B.<br>int</strong> sumMatrix(int <strong>A, int </strong>B, int n);<br>(e) The product of two square n × n matrices:<br>C = A × B<br>The entries for C are:<br>c ij =<br>n<br>X<br>k=1<br>a ik b kj<br>where 1 ≤ i,j ≤ n and c ij is the ( i , j )-th entry of the matrix C . Write the following<br>function to compute the product of two n × n square matrices:<br>int <strong> product(int </strong>A, int <em>*B, int n);<br>Bonus<br>Name the files, bonus.c and bonus.h<br>char highestFreq(char </em>str)<br>- this function should return the highest frequency character c in the string. For example, a<br>call to this function with the string “Hello World”, would return “l”,<br>3<br><br><br></string.h></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>C语言练习题，主要知识点是按指定格式解析用户输入的代表数值的字符串，然后对用户输入的字符串进行加减计算，<br>最后将计算结果按照指定的格式输出。主要涉及对字符串的解析，以及二进制，十进制，十六进制数值之间的转换，<br>以及浮点数的二进制表示等知识。<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>CS 211: Computer Architecture, Fall 2016<br>Programming Assignment 2:<br>Data Representation and Computer Arithmetic<br>1 Introduction<br>This assignment is designed to help you learn the representation, interpretation, and manipulation<br>of data as bits. There are two parts. In the first part, you will implement a program calc to add<br>and subtract numbers specified in different bases (multiplication is extra credit). In the second<br>part, you will implement a program format that will print the decimal values of bit sequences<br>representing integer and floating point data types.<br>2 Numeric Base Conversion and Calculator<br>Implement a program called calc with the following usage interface:<br>calc <op> <number1> <number2> <output base=""><br>The first argument, <op>, is either the string “+”, for addition, or “-”, for subtraction. If you<br>want to implement multiplication, then <op> can also be the string “*”. (If you do implement<br>multiplication, make sure to say so in your readme.pdf file so that the TAs know to check your<br>program for this functionality.)<br>The next two arguments, <number1> and <number2> are integers of arbitrary size. Each of these<br>numbers will be given in the form of:<br>−?(b|o|d|x)d n d n−1 …d 1 d 0<br>which can be interpreted as: a number can optionally start with a ’−’ sign, followed by a base<br>indicator, where b means the number is a binary number, o means octal, d means decimal, and x<br>means hexadecimal. d n d n−1 …d 1 d 0 are the digits of the number.<br>The final argument, <output base="">, gives the base that the resulting number should be printed<br>out in. Like the base indicator for the input numbers, this argument can be one of four strings: “b”<br>for binary, “o” for octal, “d” for decimal, and “x” for hexadecimal. Your program should output<br>the answer in the same form as the input numbers (that is, the output number should follow the<br>regular expression given above).<br>Some examples:<br>$ ./calc + d1111111111111111 d1111111111111111 d<br>d2222222222222222<br>1<br>$ ./calc + b1101 b1 d<br>d14<br>$ ./calc + d999999999 d1 d<br>d1000000000<br>$ ./calc - d10 -d4 b<br>b1110<br>$ ./calc + -d10 -d4 b<br>-b1110<br>Note that the numbers in the first example are too large to fit in a 32-bit integer type in C; this is<br>why the arbitrary size is emphasized above. Using a 64-bit integer type is not the solution since the<br>input integers can be arbitrarily large. Rather, you need to design data structures and algorithms<br>that can handle arbitrarily large numbers. Assignment update: any decimal number that we<br>ask you to handle—either an input decimal number or output in decimal format—will<br>fit in a 32-bit integer.<br>Important: You must write the base conversion code yourself. You may not use type-casting,<br>libraries, or output formats in printf(). You may use standard C arithmetic operations. You may<br>use the C standard libraries for functionality not related to the conversion (e.g., string handling<br>functions).<br>Important: If calc detects an error in the inputs, it should print out an error message that starts<br>with the string “ERROR”, followed by a string that gives an informative message about the error<br>that it detected.<br>3 Format Interpretation<br>Implement a program called format with the following usage interface:<br>format <input bit="" sequence=""> <type><br>The first argument, <input bit="" sequence="">, is a sequence of 32 bits. Remember that your C<br>program will get it as a string of 1 and 0 characters in the argv[1] argument to main. This<br>sequence ofbits represents the binary values stored in 4 contiguous bytes in memory. The leftmost<br>bits are stored in the byte with the smallest address while the rightmost bits are stored in the byte<br>with the largest address.<br>The second argument, <type>, gives the type that you should use to interpret the input bit<br>sequence, and can be either int (integer) or float.<br>The formats for the input bit sequence is as follows. If the type is:<br>int: the format is two’s complement;<br>float: the format is IEEE 754 single precision;<br>Note that the input bit sequence can correspond to negative numbers.<br>2<br>Your program should print out the decimal representation of the input bit sequence, assuming a<br>big endian byte ordering. Floating point numbers should be printed in scientific notation, where a<br>number 1.5x10 5 would be printed as 1.5e5. For positive infinity, output pinf, for negative infinity,<br>output ninf, and for “NaN”, output NaN.<br>Here are some examples:<br>$ ./format 01000001010000100100001101000100 int<br>1094861636<br>$ ./format 10000001010000100100001101000100 int<br>-2126363836<br>$ ./format 01000001010000100100001110000100 int<br>1094861700<br>$ ./format 00000000000000000000000000000001 int<br>1<br>$ ./format 01000000110000110100001111010100 float<br>6.10203e0<br>$ ./format 00111010000111111111011000001000 float<br>6.1e-4<br>$ ./format 10000000000000000000000000000000 float<br>-0.0e0<br>$ ./format 01000000010010010000111111011011 float<br>3.141593e0<br>Important: You must write the interpretation code yourself. You may not use type-casting,<br>libraries, or output formats in printf(). You may use standard C arithmetic operations. You may<br>use the C standard libraries for functionality not related to the value interpretation (e.g., string<br>handling functions).<br>Important: If format detects an error in the inputs, it should print out an error message that<br>starts with the string “ERROR”, followed by a string that gives an informative message about the<br>error that it detected. For this program, you can assume that any input bit sequence that is shorter<br>or longer than 32 bits is erroneous.<br>4 Submission<br>You have to e-submit the assignment using Sakai. Your submission should be a tar file named<br>pa2.tar that can be extracted using the command:<br>tar xf pa2.tar<br>3<br>Your tar file must contain:<br>• readme.pdf: this file should describe your design and implementation of the calc program.<br>In particular, it should detail your design, any design/implementation challenges that you<br>ran into, and an analysis (e.g., big-O analysis) of the space and time performance of your<br>program.<br>• makefile: there should be at least the following rules in your makefile:<br>all build both your calc and format executables.<br>calc build your calc executable.<br>format build your format executable.<br>clean remove all object files and executables. Prepare for rebulding from scratch.<br>• source code: All source code and header files necessary for building your calc and format<br>executables. These should at least include calc.c and format.c.<br>You can build your pa2.tgz file in the following steps:<br>1. Put all the files you want to hand in in a subdirectory called pa2.<br>2. In the parent directory that contains pa2, invoke tar:<br>tar cvfz pa2.tgz pa2<br>The arguments to tar are cfvz. The c tells tar to create a new archive file. The f tells tar that the<br>next command line argument is the name of the output file. The z tells tar to compress the tar file<br>with gzip. The v just makes tar list the files it’s putting into the archive.<br>We will compile and test your program on the iLab machines so you should make sure that your<br>program compiles and runs correctly on these machines. You must compile all C code using the<br>gcc compiler with the -Wall flags.<br>5 Grading Guidelines<br>5.1 Functionality<br>This is a large class so that necessarily the most significant part of your grade will be based on<br>programmatic checking of your program. That is, we will build a binary using the Makefile and<br>source code that you submitted, and then test the binary for correct functionality against a set of<br>inputs. Thus:<br>• You should make sure that we can build your program by just running make.<br>• You should test your code as thoroughly as you can. In particular, your code should be adept<br>at handling exceptional cases.<br>Be careful to follow all instructions. If something doesn’t seem right, ask.<br>4<br>5.2 Design<br>Having said the above about functionality, design is a critical part of any programming exercise.<br>In particular, we expect you to write reasonably efficient code based on reasonably performing<br>algorithms and data structures. More importantly, you need to understand the performance (time<br>&amp; space) implications of the algorithms and data structures you chose to use. Thus, the explanation<br>of your design and analyses in the readme.pdf will comprise a non-trivial part of your grade. Give<br>careful thoughts to your writing of this file, rather than writing whatever comes to your mind in the<br>last few minutes before the assignment is due.<br>5.3 Coding Style<br>Finally, it is important that you write “good” code. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to look at<br>your code as closely as we would like to give you good feedback. Nevertheless, a part of your grade<br>will depend on the quality of your code. Here are some guidelines for what we consider to be good:<br>• Your code is modularized. That is, your code is split into pieces that make sense, where the<br>pieces are neither too small nor too big.<br>• Your code is well documented with comments. This does not mean that you should comment<br>every line of code. Common practice is to document each function (the parameters it takes<br>as input, the results produced, any side-effects, and the function’s functionality) and add<br>comments in the code where it will help another programmer figure out what is going on.<br>• You use variable names that have some meaning (rather than cryptic names like i).<br>Further, you should observe the following protocols to make it easier for us to look at your code:<br>• Define prototypes for all functions.<br>• Place all prototype, typedef, and struct definitions in header (.h) files.<br>• Error and warning messages should be printed to stderr using fprintf.<br>5<br><br><br><br></type></type></output></number2></number1></op></op></output></number2></number1></op></font>

Submission system shuts off at 5pm.<br>Directions<br>Complete the following homework assignment using the description given in each section.<br>IMPORTANT INFO<br>tc.rnet will be down for maintenance during the course of the week of 10/3, it is anticipated<br>to be back up quickly but in order to be safe there is a temporary server created to work on hw2,<br>which will be taken down as soon as the former is back up and running. So in order to not lose your<br>code follow the instructions.<br>Logging in to the new server:<br>Putty: hostname =  test.rnet.missouri.edu<br>Terminal on a mac: ssh pawprint@test.rnet.missouri.edu<br>Notice the change of server, you will be logging into a different server (test.rnet.missouri.edu) and<br>not your original server (tc.rnet.missouri.edu).<br>USE FTP clients like FileZilla or WinSCP to back up your files to your local machine. The test.rnet<br>server is a temporary one and will be take down during the week of 10/3 after tc.rnet is back,<br>unfortunately we have no control over the timings, so whenever you code something make sure you<br>keep backing the file up immediately on your local machine. Like, every 15 minutes or once you<br>finish one function or whenever you quit out of test.rnet.<br>Once you get an announcement on BLACKBOARD from DHEERAJ, saying “tc.rnet is back and<br>running” move the local copy to tc.rnet server.

Which will be developed by you. This<br>application helps in reserving flight seats. This is done via implementing the 8 user-defined<br>functions as explained below.<br>Your program must print a menu for the user to select what he needs to do with the application.<br>There will be admin mode which requires log-in via a passcode. There will be an option for<br>reserving a seat on a flight. Third option is to exit the application.<br>A file templateHW2.c is attached on Blackboard which will guide you on how to start the<br>program and what are the global variables you need to use and how. You can follow that.<br>Comments and prototypes have been given for you to help you out in the process.<br>GLOBAL CONSTANTS and VARIABLES:<br>#define ROW 6 //for row length<br>#define COL 4 //for column length<br>#define MAX 25 // for strings<br><br>Functions to implement:<br>1. void initialSeats(char flight[][COL], int count);<br>The initialSeats function takes in a two-dimensional char array created in main. It will initialize<br>all array elements to the character ‘O’. ‘O’ symbolizes the seat on the plane is open and can be<br>taken. The int count variable is used to symbolize the number of people who already have a seat<br>on the plane, this is a random number generated and sent from main. In this function it will<br>randomly create and assign an index in the two-dimensional array with the character ‘X’ for each<br>person up to value of count. ‘X’ is used to symbolize that an element in the two dimensional<br>array is occupied. This will be used later on in the program. MAKE SURE TO SEED RAND in<br>MAIN. Below is the way to randomly generate the seats for each passenger to take. This<br>function should be called as soon as your program starts.<br>Keep in mind the possibility of the randomized index overwriting ‘X’, if it was already there.<br>You have to handle that case. Beware!!<br>int row = rand() % ROW;<br>int col = rand() % COL;<br>2. void displayMenu();<br>Prints the display options. Admin mode, Reserve a seat and Exit. This is the main menu.<br>3. void printFlightMap(char flight[][COL]);<br>The printFlightMap function is printing off a two-dimensional character array. Thus, printing off<br>the characters stored in each index of the two-dimensional array either ‘O’ or ‘X’. As noted<br>above the ROW and COL are #defined in your program, use them. For loops are your friends<br>here. Called in admin mode and during reserving a seat (specifically in seatReservation).<br>4. int loginMatch(int passcode, int adminPasscode);<br>The loginMatch function is called to compare the passcodes, the function returns 1 if both match<br>and 0 if there is no match. This is called in admin mode. Should prompt for the passcode entry<br>until the passcode matches. The adminPasscode is specified, everyone should use the same<br>adminPassocde, then compare that with the passcode user enters in main() when they wish to<br>log-in.<br>5.  int getTotalRevenue(char f1[][COL], char f2[][COL], char f3[ ][COL]);<br>Note: f1, f2, f3 are flight1, flight2, flight3, just shorthanded.<br>The getTotalRevenue function will take in all three two-dimensional character arrays created in<br>main and calculate the total revenue using the costMatrix two dimensional array. With each two-<br>dimensional array f1, f2, and f3, search for the character ‘X’ stored in them, upon finding the<br>index of the character ‘X’, use the index to reference inside of the global two-dimensional array<br>costMatrix (look above in Constants and Global Variables). While inside of costMatrix array,<br>add the value stored in the two-dimensional array with a running total variable (Hint use +=).<br>The function will return the total revenue earned thus far from seats reserved in all 3 flights. So,<br>you will need nested for-loops. This is called only in admin mode.<br>6. void flightMenu();<br>Prints the three flight options as shown. Flights to Miami, Nashville and Las Vegas. This is done<br>when reserve a seat option is chosen.<br>7. void seatReservation(char flight[][COL]);<br>The seatReservation function takes in a two-dimensional array and allows the user to reserve an<br>index on the two-dimensional array. Before any reserving is done, this function calls the<br>printFlightMap function mentioned earlier to allow the user to see the already populated two-<br>dimensional array for that flight. Then, the user is asked to enter a row and column to reserve a<br>seat. Additionally, this function will have built in error checking (look below at output<br>example) Once the user has inputted a correct index within [0, ROW) and [0, COL) in the two-<br>dimensional array, this function needs to check if that index entered is already taken in the two-<br>dimensional array with the character ‘X.’ If the index is populated with ‘X’, an error will be<br>shown to the user (look at the output below) and have them re-enter a new possible row and<br>column again. If the index entered is not filled with ‘X’, then assign that index with ‘X’, i.e.<br>changing the element from ‘O’ to ‘X’. Before the function ends, it will call the function<br>printFlightMap again and prints a success message.<br>Remember, rows run from 0-5 and columns from 0-3. Error check for this too.<br>8. void printMessage(char name[],char num[]);<br>//DO THIS, IF YOU ARE DOING THE BONUS<br>This function is called for each flight option after the seatReservation() is called. It takes in two<br>strings, name of passenger and the flight number for that particular case. Both are character<br>arrays (strings). For flight Cou-&gt;Miami number must be set as “MIA1050”, for Cou-&gt;Nashville<br>number must be set as “BNA1050”, for flight Cou-&gt;Las Vegas num must be set as “LAS1050”,<br>this must be done in main and the name and particular number must be sent to this function.<br>Once in this function, you will merge (important part) the two strings into third string and print<br>that as the e-Ticket as shown below and print a confirmation message.<br>Eg1: name is “Fred” number is “MIA1050”, your merged string should be FMrIeAd1050. Print<br>this as the booking confirmation number.<br>Eg2: name is “Guilliams” number is “LAS1050”, you merged string should be<br>GLuAiSl1l0i5a0ms.<br>Eg3: name is “Christopher” number is “BNA1050”, your merged string should be<br>CBhNrAi1s0t5o0pher<br>9. int main(void)<br>The main function will be doing all (most of) the function calls. In main, you need to create four<br>character arrays of flight_1[ROW][COL], flight_2[ROW][COL], flight_3[ROW][COL], and<br>strings name[MAX],flight_number[MAX]<br>adminPasscode= 105016; // everyone must keep this the same<br>Also, before you call initialSeats function on all the flights arrays individually, make sure to find<br>how many people already reserved seats. This is done by creating a local variable<br>seats = rand % 5 + 1 (this is your int counts in initialSeats function), rand()%5 +1 will give a<br>random number between 1-5; you only need to do this once. A menu system will be displayed for<br>the users to run specific parts of the program (See output below of what the menu system needs<br>to look like). Make sure to implement error checking for invalid input!<br>On the main menu, the user will see a display of options: The options are 1: Admin Portal, 2:<br>Reserve a seat on a flight, and 3: Quit. The menu will need to loop until the exit option is<br>chosen.<br>To access the Admin Portal, the user enters a 1, and then must type a passcode that will be<br>stored in a variable. Now, verify the passcode, call the loginMatch function (you should<br>compare) with passcode and adminPasscode to verify if it is an authentic log-in attempt. If the<br>pair match, that is, they are equivalent then it means successful log-in. Upon successful<br>verification, inside of the admin portal, call printFlightMap on each flight array and<br>getTotalRevenue (See output below). Declare these variables in main().<br>To access Reserve a seat, the user enters a 2. Inside of this portal, the user is displayed the three<br>flights that can be accessed to book a seat. (See below output). As always, verify the user input<br>for flight option (1-5). 2 character arrays will be used, name and flight_number. Once a valid<br>flight option is chosen. Switch to that particular case and ask for the user’s first name and store<br>it in name[] and store the flight numbers (MIA1050,BNA1050,LAS1050) in flight_number[] as<br>specified above for that flight. Then, send the corresponding flight array to seatReservation,<br>after successful reservation the user will be relocated back to the main menu. Then print a<br>success message using name and fligh_number, just to confirm the booking.<br>Must be done for each case (each flight).<br>Then, if you are doing the bonus, call the printMessage with name[] and that particular<br>flight_number[],. Note: flight1 is Miami, flight2 is Nashville, flight3 is Las Vegas.<br>Please go through Sample Output and the document clearly before starting out.<br>Sample Output<br>Character in bold are inputs from the user. Yours will vary but the outline must look similar. It is big,<br>don’t worry, but will help give you a better idea. I have run it twice completely, that’s why it is 10<br>pages.<br><br><br></filename></assignment></class></font>

You are required to meet with a TA within two weeks from<br>the due date to demo, and you receive an automatic 50 point deduction for<br>failure to do so. If you miss a scheduled appointment, you will be penalized 10<br>points for rescheduling within 1 day (24 hours), 25 points within 7 days (1 week),<br>and 50 points for anything outside of a week. Your job is to convince the TA that<br>your program works correctly, i.e. show your TA how to use/break your program☺<br>(90 pts) Program Implementation: Problem Statement<br>You are the proud owner of a virtual zoo that has places to house tigers, polar<br>bears, and penguins! You will write a Zoo Tycoon game using classes and<br>inheritance. Zoo Tycoon is a game where the user creates a zoo that has exhibits with a<br>number of different animals in each. Your zoo animals can be Tigers, Polar Bears, and<br>Penguins. You start with an initial amount of money in your zoo bank, and from there<br>you can begin to op.<br>Specific Animal traits:<br>• Age<br>o &gt;=3, adult <3, 1="" 2="" 3="" 5="" baby="" •="" cost="" o="" tigers="" $10,000,="" polar="" bears="" $5,000="" and="" penguins="" $1,000.="" babies="" have="" baby,="" babies,="" babies.="" average="" food="" you="" can="" get="" this="" from="" the="" user="" or="" set="" it="" as="" a="" constant="" for="" an="" animal.="" feeding="" of="" times="" per="" animal,="" animal="" example:="" $10.="" payoff="" 10%="" their="" plus="" bonus="" in="" (like="" other="" animals)="" 5%="" game="" flow:="" begin="" your="" zoo="" with="" specified="" amount="" money,="" e.g.="" 100,000="" dollars.="" buy="" either="" one="" two="" each="" to="" start="" zoo.="" time="" that="" is="" subtracted="" bank.="" bought="" starts="" age="" value="" 3.="" turn="" “day”.="" at="" beginning="" day,="" increases="" day="" older,="" pays="" required,="" so="" animals="" don’t="" die.="" after="" money="" bank,="" randomized="" event="" takes="" place.="" random="" events:="" 1)="" sickness="" occurs="" zoo,="" ask="" which="" will="" die,="" subtract="" budget.="" 2)="" boom="" attendance="" occurs,="" generate="" tigers,="" 250-500="" dollars="" add="" back="" into="" budget="" reward="" 3)="" born,="" having="" if="" there="" old="" enough="" be="" parent,=""> 3<br>• add number of babies born to that specific animal type to the exhibit<br>• else, reprompt the user for an animal.<br>• begin baby at age 0,<br>4) nothing happens.<br>After the random event, calculate your payoffs for the day based on normal visits for<br>penguins and polar bears, and possibly a bonus from a boom in attendance to see the<br>tigers!<br>Last, ask the player if they want to buy an adult animal, continue to the next day, or end<br>the game. If they chose to buy an animal, subtract that cost and add the animal to the<br>appropriate exhibit.<br>When you add money for profit or subtract money for sickness, the babies, or<br>animals with an age value less than 3 “days”, have a value of 2 times their normal<br>payoff or cost.<br>Requirements<br>• Each exhibit is a dynamic array of each type of animal.<br>• You must have classes for a zoo, animal, tiger, penguin, and polar bear.<br>• You Must Implement Inheritance: Your tiger, penguin, and polar bear must<br>inherit some traits and behaviors from the animal class, while there may be<br>others unique to the specific animal, such as a bonus for tigers.<br>• Every time you buy an animal, at the beginning of the game or during play time,<br>subtract that animals cost from the bank.<br>• Subtract the feeding cost (which depends on how many animals you own and<br>what kind) every morning.<br>• Have a random event take place during each turn and perform those bank<br>transactions correctly.<br>• Animals that aren’t “born” in the zoo start at age 3 and this age is incremented<br>every day.

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>基本思路:<br>一共有两题<br>第一题:判断读取文件是否是回文文件,根据题目定义理解什么事回文文件,用递归来判断一个单词是否是回文,再判断整个文件<br>第二题:完成一个类似抽奖的游戏,给对应图片编号记录分数,根据最终摇到的图片的分数来计算选手的得分,最后得出胜负<br>注意点:<br>第一题:读取文件的时候会发生一系列IO异常,要仔细处理<br>第二题:组件的位置要仔细调整,做出摇奖的动画比较麻烦,要然位置变化先慢后快再慢,得到滚动的效果<br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>Programming Assignment 7 ( 100 Points )<br>Due: 11:59pm Thursday, November 10th<br>README ( 10 points )<br>You are required to provide a text file named README, NOT Readme.txt, README.pdf, or<br>README.doc, with your assignment in your pa7 directory. There should be no file extension after the file name<br>“README”. Your README should include the following sections:<br>Program Descriptions ( 5 points ) : Provide a high level description of what each of your programs do and<br>how you can interact with them. Make this explanation such that your grandpa or uncle or someone you know<br>who has no programming experience can understand what these programs do and how to use them. Do not<br>assume your reader is a computer science major.<br>Short Response ( 5 points ) : Answer the following questions:<br>Vim Questions:<br>1. In vim/gvim, what commands will indent N consecutive lines (starting from the cursor line) by one level<br>where the indent level is defined to be two spaces? This will take two vim commands: one to set the<br>number of spaces to indent with each indent level (default is 8), and one to actually indent N<br>consecutive lines. Likewise what command will shift N lines left (de-indent N lines)?<br>2. In vim/gvim, what command will indent an entire curly-bracket block one level, while the cursor is<br>currently on either the open or close curly bracket of the block? Likewise what command will shift an<br>entire curly-bracket block one level left (de-indent block)?<br>3. How do you open a new line below and insert (one keyboard key for both steps)?<br>Unix Question:<br>4. On the Unix command line, how can you capture (redirect) the program’s output into a file named<br>“output”?<br>Java Question:<br>5. How can you create an array of ints in Java and initialize it with the values of all single digit odd positive<br>numbers (inclusively between 0-9), all in one step/line?<br>STYLE ( 20 points )<br>Please see preview programming assignments; especially PA2’s writeup.  You will be specifically graded on<br>commenting, file headers, class and method headers, meaningful variable names, judicious use of blank lines,<br>not having more than 80 characters on a line, perfect indentation, no magic numbers/hard-coded numbers<br>other than -1, 0, +1, using setters and getters, etc (see the style section of PA2’s writeup).<br>You will lose significant points if you have static methods or static variables for the Spin100 program<br>(except, constants are okay). Instead you should create getters and setters to change the variables for an<br>object.<br>CORRECTNESS ( 70 points )<br>Start by creating your pa7 directory as usual. Then copy over the starter code from the public folder by doing<br>the following:<br>$ cp ~/../public/PA7indrome.java ~/pa7<br>$ cp ~/../public/PA7-images/<em> ~/pa7<br>Program 1: PA7indrome ( 20 Points )<br>You must use recursion and implement the methods listed below or you will lose all 20 points for this<br>program. Also,  do not edit the main() method in PA7indrome.java as it will negatively affect your grade.<br>Write a command line application that checks whether an array of strings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a<br>word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same forwards and backwards. The<br>program will take in a file as a command line argument. Each line of the file will be converted into a string,<br>where each string will be placed as an element in an arraylist then converted to an array (this part has already<br>been written for you in the main() method–do not edit anything in this method). Your task will be to then<br>determine if the array of strings is a palindrome or not (non-case sensitive). You will be using two recursive<br>methods to implement this functionality.<br>public static char[] reverse( char[] toRev ) {…}<br>● Overall goal: reverse the array of characters passed in using recursion.<br>● If the length of the character array passed in is 1, just return the array right away.<br>● Otherwise, swap the first and last characters in the array (#1-3 below)<br>● Copy the middle of the array into a new array and recursively call reverse on this new array (#4 below).<br>● Place the returned array back into the middle of the original array of characters, and return this<br>reversed array of characters (#5 below).<br>● Hint: you can use System.arraycopy() (look up the javadocs).<br>● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.<br>public static boolean isPalindrome( String[] words, int lo, int hi ) {…}<br>● Overall goal: determine if the array of strings passed in is a palindrome using recursion.<br>● Determine if the string at the low index in the words array is the reverse of the string at the high index in<br>the words array. To do so, you must use your reverse() function, after converting the string to a char<br>array and passing it in. This comparison should be non-case sensitive.<br>● If the string at the low index is indeed the reverse of the string at the high index, recurse on the<br>remaining middle portion of the array by passing modified values of the low and high index in the<br>recursive call. Otherwise, return false.<br>● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.<br>You must use these methods as they are defined above or you will lose points.<br>We will test for edge cases when grading this assignment, so it is up to you to test your program thoroughly.<br>Similar to previous assignments, your output MUST match exactly to our sample output!<br>Sample Output 1: Not a palindrome (user input in BOLD)<br>For this example, the input file is named notPalindrome. If you open the file in vim, it should look like this:<br>start<br>early<br>start<br>often<br>The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome notPalindrome<br>Input array of strings:<br>start, early, start, often<br>The file is not a palindrome.<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$<br>Sample Output 2: Odd-length palindrome (user input in BOLD)<br>Input file named oddPalindrome:<br>StArT<br>EaRlY<br>sTaRt<br>oFtEn<br>ufotofu<br>NeTfO<br>TrAtS<br>yLrAe<br>tRaTs<br>The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome oddPalindrome<br>Input array of strings:<br>StArT, EaRlY, sTaRt, oFtEn, ufotofu, NeTfO, TrAtS, yLrAe, tRaTs<br>The file is a palindrome.<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$<br>The sequence of characters in the array of Strings generated from the input file reads the same forwards and<br>backwards (non-case sensitive), so it is a palindrome. Note that because the length of the array is odd, the<br>middle string must also be a palindrome (in this case the middle string is “ufotofu”, which is a palindrome).<br>Sample Output 3: Even-length palindrome (user input in BOLD)<br>Input file named evenPalindrome:<br>StArT<br>EaRlY<br>sTaRt<br>oFtEn<br>NeTfO<br>TrAtS<br>yLrAe<br>tRaTs<br>The output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome evenPalindrome<br>Input array of strings:<br>StArT, EaRlY, sTaRt, oFtEn, NeTfO, TrAtS, yLrAe, tRaTs<br>The file is a palindrome.<br>[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$<br>Sample Output 4: Palindrome with new lines (user input in BOLD)<br>Input file named newLinesPalindrome.

Player 1 gets to spin the wheel first. Player 1 gets to<br>spin until they have reached over 100 points or have clicked the “Finish Player 1” button. At that point,<br>it becomes Player 2’s turn. Player 2 then gets to spin until they have reached over 100 points or have<br>clicked the “Finish Player 2” button.<br>● Once Player 2 goes over 100 points or clicks the “Finish Player 2” button, the game ends.<br>● Whichever player is closer to 100 points wins. Once a player goes over 100 points then they’ve lost. If<br>both players go over 100 points then it’s a tie. If both players have the same score, then it’s a tie.<br>Example scores and their outcomes:<br>Player 1  70  120  20  100  100  95<br>Player 2  90  110  120  100  105  100<br>Winner  Player 2  Tie  Player 1  Tie  Player 1  Player 2<br>Implementation Details:<br>This program will have two Java source files: Spin100Controller.java and Spin100Wheel.java.<br>Spin100Controller.java will be the main controller which extends WindowController and handles the GUI<br>layout. Spin100Wheel.java will be the actual wheel object that defines what a wheel can do, how it spins, etc.<br>1. Setting up the GUI:<br>Start by first getting the GUI set up in the begin() method of Spin100Controller.java.<br>The top panel will have 3 labels:<br>● “Spin100” - You can customize the font of this label–don’t worry about whether the font is the default or<br>not! Just make sure your program doesn’t throw errors or have an incorrect layout / text upon start.<br>● “Player 1’s score: “ - followed by player 1’s score (initially 0).<br>● “Player 2’s score: “ - followed by player 2’s score (initially 0).<br>○ Note the space following the ‘:’ for each player’s score<br>The bottom panel will have 5 buttons: (make sure the text matches exactly).<br>● “Click to Spin P1”<br>● “Finish Player 1”<br>● “Restart”<br>● “Click to Spin P2”<br>● “Finish Player 2”<br>The wheels on the center canvas:<br>● The center of the window will have the canvas, similar to PA6. The height and width of the canvas<br>should be 840 x 660. Note that the canvas will not be resized during testing. On the canvas we will<br>be displaying two wheels (one for each player). In order to create the wheels, we need to initialize an<br>array of Image(s), using the images you copied over from the public folder. Make sure your images<br>are directly inside your pa7 directory, and not in a subdirectory called PA7-images.<br>● You will want to load the 20 images into an array of Images. To ensure you arrange the images in the<br>correct order, we suggest creating the following array. This will ensure you load the images in the<br>correct order and will also be helpful for scoring later on. Load the images corresponding to these<br>score values in the order in which they appear in the array. The array of images and the array of score<br>values will be parallel arrays.<br>private static final int[] SCORES = { 50, 85, 30, 65, 10, 45, 70, 25, 90, 5,<br>100, 15, 80, 35, 60, 20, 40, 75, 55, 95 };<br>● The wheel should always start with 50 in the center and should spin in a downward direction. This<br>means that when the wheel spins for the first time, the red arrow will first point to 50, then 85, then 30,<br>and so on.<br>● You will want to create each wheel by calling the Spin100Wheel constructor. Some parameters you will<br>probably want to pass to the constructor are:<br>○ The array of Image(s) corresponding to the SCORES values.<br>○ Location of the wheel (location of the top number). The center of the left wheel should be<br>horizontally aligned with the center of the left half of the canvas. In other words, you need to find<br>the x-coordinate that will center the left wheel in the center of the left half of the canvas.<br>Similarly, you need to find the x-coordinate that will center the right wheel in the center of the<br>right half of the canvas. The y-coordinate of the top number for both wheels should be 10 (make<br>sure the layout of your wheels matches the screenshots exactly).<br>○ Reference to the Spin100Controller so that controller methods can be called from the wheel<br>(this will be useful for setting the score after the wheel stops spinning each time)<br>○ Reference to the drawing canvas so the wheel can be placed on the canvas<br>The red arrows on the center canvas:<br>● The arrows are red-filled arcs with start angle = -15, arc angle = 30, height = 150, and width = 150.<br>● Left arrow position: (234.5, 186.0)<br>● Right arrow position: (688.5, 186.0)<br>Messages declaring winner on the center canvas:<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “Tie” at position (444, 5). The text should be blue, bold, and size 16.<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “P1 Winner” at position (20, 5). The text should be green, bold, and<br>size 16.<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “P2 Winner” at position (808, 5). The text should be green, bold,<br>and size 16.<br>See the screenshot section below to see what all of this looks like.<br>2. Wheel Functionality<br>Because the wheels are animated, the Spin100Wheel class needs to extend ActiveObject (and therefore must<br>contain a run() method).<br>Creating a wheel:<br>● Each wheel needs an array of 5 VisibleImages (generated from the array of images passed in as a<br>parameter to the constructor) to store the 5 images that will be visible on the canvas at any given time.<br>● The location passed to the constructor is the location of the topmost VisibleImage. The next<br>VisibleImage will be 99 pixels below that, and the next 99 pixels below that, and so on.<br>● Each wheel needs a random double generator object to generate random numbers for the amount of<br>ticks to spin when the spin button is clicked (see more details below in the Spinning the wheel section).<br>● Don’t forget to save a reference to the Spin100Controller object to help with scoring.<br>● Set the number of ticks to 0, so the wheel begins stationary.<br>● As with all ActiveObjects, the last statement in the constructor should be start();.<br>Spinning the wheel:<br>● Initially, the wheel’s number of ticks should be set to zero. When a wheel’s spin button is clicked, the<br>controller should update the number of ticks so the wheel will start spinning. This means you will want<br>a method to generate a random number of ticks for the wheel to spin.<br>● One way to implement this is to have a method called getRandomTicks(). This method should:<br>○ First generate a random double between 0 and 1<br>○ Based on the random number, return the minimum number of ticks (50) + a number of<br>additional ticks, which indicates how many ticks a wheel should spin for. This is to allow the<br>wheel to stop on different numbers each time by randomizing where a wheel stops cycling<br>through the array of images.<br>○ If the random number is between 0 and 0.05, return MIN_TICKS + 1. If it’s between .05 and .1,<br>return MIN_TICKS + 2. You should keep adding one more tick until you return MIN_TICKS + 13<br>for when the value is between .6 and .65. From there you should subtract one less tick until you<br>return MIN_TICKS + 6 when the value is between .95 and 1.<br>■ Range of ticks to add (over the .05 increments) is<br>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6)<br>● After getting the random number of ticks, the controller needs to set the wheel’s number of ticks using a<br>setter method.<br>● To make the wheel actually spin, the run method will need to constantly check its number of ticks. If<br>the number of ticks is greater than 0, increment the index of each visible image displayed to the next<br>index in the images array; in other words, for every tick, shift the images down one. Once you reach<br>the last index of the images array, wrap back around to the beginning (Hint: think mod operator).<br>Then decrement the number of ticks left for this wheel to spin and pause to slow down the animation.<br>● At the beginning of each spin, the initial delay should be set to 1. Then when the wheel delay is less<br>than 20, the wheel delay should increment by 1 on every iteration of the forever loop. When the wheel<br>delay is greater than or equal to 20 and less than 200, the wheel delay should increment by 5. When<br>the wheel delay is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 500, the wheel delay should increment by<br>20. This will give the illusion of a faster spin at the start which eventually slows down and stops once<br>the number of ticks is zero.<br>● Once the number of ticks is 0, the wheel needs to call a public method in controller to let the controller<br>know that the wheel’s score has changed and that the Text object for the score needs to be updated.<br>● Some additional methods to include in the class would be setters and getters for the ticks, delay, and<br>score. This is so that the controller can call these methods and change the wheel’s variables’ values<br>when something like the spin, finish, or reset button is pressed.<br>3. Controller Functionality<br>You will implement Spin100Controller.java to handle creating the buttons and listening to actions performed on<br>the buttons.<br>● Upon start, only the “Click to Spin P1” and “Restart” buttons should be enabled. So in your begin()<br>method, in addition to setting up the layouts of the buttons, you should also disable the “Finish Player 1”<br>button and all buttons associated with Player 2.<br>● Once you have clicked “Click to Spin P1”, all buttons are disabled until the wheel stops spinning. Once<br>the wheel stops spinning, update Player 1’s score. Now that you have spun Player 1’s wheel at least<br>once, the “Finish Player 1” button should be enabled.<br>● As long as Player 1’s score is less than or equal to 100, Player 1 can choose to continue spinning by<br>clicking “Click to Spin P1” again, or click “Finish Player 1” to finish their turn. Once Player 1’s score is<br>over 100, the controller will automatically finish the turn for Player 1.<br>● Once Player 1 has finished, all of Player 1’s buttons are disabled and the “Click to Spin P2” button is<br>enabled for Player 2 to start spinning. The spinning process follows the same condition as stated for<br>Player 1.<br>● Once Player 2 has also finished, all but the Restart button should be disabled. A game over message<br>should be displayed. The message could announce a Tie, or announce that either Player 1 or Player 2<br>won (see screenshots for detail).<br>Summary of the buttons<br>● The Spin buttons: The spin button disables itself when:<br>○ The wheels are spinning<br>○ The player’s score has passed 100<br>○ The player has clicked finish after at least one spin<br>● The Finish buttons: Each player’s finish button is disabled until they have spun at least once. It is also<br>disabled when the wheel is spinning, as well as after they have finished their turn.<br>● The Restart button: This button is always enabled except when a wheel is spinning. Once clicked:<br>○ It changes the scores back to 0<br>○ It resets the wheels so that 50 is at the center again<br>○ The “Click To Spin P1” button is enabled again and the buttons are reset to the original state.<br>Implementation Requirements for Button Event Handling<br>To manage the behaviors of the 5 buttons, you must define 5 private member inner classes inside the<br>Spin100Controller class. Use your notes from class as a reference.<br>● Each private class must implement the ActionListener interface.<br>● The ActionListener interface enforces that each class has the actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method<br>declared and implemented.<br>Having separate inner classes for each button is much better than handling all button events in one<br>actionPerformed() method. This is because there is a one-to-one relationship between buttons and listeners,<br>resulting in cleaner code that is less prone to errors.<br>Note: Remember to use getters/setters vs. directly accessing variables by name.<br>4. Sample Screenshots:<br>The start of the program. Both<br>player’s scores are set to 0,<br>with the arrows pointing to 50.<br>Only the buttons: “Click to Spin<br>P1” and “Restart” are enabled.<br>After Player 1 clicks “Click to<br>Spin P1”, the score for Player<br>1 is updated. The “Finish<br>Player 1” button is now<br>enabled after 1 spin.<br>Player 1 clicks “Finish Player<br>1”, and now only “Restart” and<br>“Click to Spin P2” buttons are<br>enabled.<br>Player 2 now clicks “Click to<br>Spin P2”, the score for Player<br>2 is updated. “Finish Player 2”<br>button is now enabled after the<br>first spin.<br>After Player 2 clicks “Finish<br>Player 2” The winner text<br>appears. The only button<br>enabled is “Restart”.<br>This is the case when Player<br>1’s score is over 100, thus<br>Player 2 wins.<br>In the case that Player 1’s<br>score exceeds 100, the<br>buttons “Click to Spin P1” and<br>“Finish Player 1” are<br>automatically disabled,<br>allowing P2 to begin.<br>If both player’s scores exceed<br>100, the game results in a tie.<br>Turnin<br>To turnin your code, navigate to your home directory and run the following command:<br>&gt; cse11turnin pa7<br>You may turn in your programming assignment as many times as you like.

Set the canvas width to 1000 and the canvas height to 660.<br>Overall Wins: 1 Point<br>Keep track of the overall wins with a message that appears at the end of the game:<br>Overall Wins P1: #, P2 @<br>where # is a non-negative number indicating how many times player 1 has won the game and @ is a non-<br>negative number indicating how many times player 2 has won the game. This message cannot overlap either<br>wheel and it should be horizontally centered between the wheels. It should be 200 pixels above the vertical<br>center of the canvas. The message can be in whatever color you would like besides black. In the case of a tie,<br>neither player’s win count should change.<br>Change Spin Direction: 1 Point<br>Add some new buttons and change the old ones so that each player has the option to spin up or down. There<br>should be a “P1, Spin Up” button, “P1, Spin Down” button, “P2, Spin Up” button, and “P2, Spin Down” button.<br>To clarify, spinning up is where the numbers appear to be moving up (so the 50 goes towards the top) whereas<br>spinning down is where the numbers appear to be moving down (so the 50 moves towards the bottom). You<br>can see the new buttons in the screenshots below. Disabling the buttons should still work the same as it does<br>in the normal portion of the PA, just make sure to disable both the Up and Down spin buttons.<br>Switch Starting Players: 3 Points<br>The “Switch” button is enabled only at the start of each round of the game. This button should be disabled in<br>the middle of a game (i.e. if a spin has occurred). This allows the player who spins first to switch with the other<br>player. For instance, if Player 1 was going to start first and the switch button is clicked. then the game will<br>restart and Player 2 will now start first. If the restart button were then clicked, Player 2 would still be going first.<br>Sample Screenshots:<br>If all extra credit features are implemented, this is the initial state of the program.<br>The overall number of wins for each player is shown when a round finishes.<br>Player 2 can begin the round of a game when “Switch” is clicked.<br><br><br></font>
